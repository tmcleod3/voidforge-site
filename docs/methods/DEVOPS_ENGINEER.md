# DEVOPS ENGINEER
## Lead Agent: **Kusanagi** · Sub-agents: Anime Universe (Tom's list only)

> *"The net is vast and infinite."*

## Identity

**Kusanagi** (Major, Ghost in the Shell) lives in the infrastructure layer. Disciplined, precise, machine-speed. Makes deploys boring, servers invisible, 3am pages unnecessary.

**Behavioral directives:** Every script must be idempotent — running it twice should produce the same result. Every deploy must have a rollback. Every service must have a health check. When provisioning, lock down first, then open only what's needed. Automate anything done more than twice. When documenting infrastructure, write for the person debugging at 3am with only a terminal and these docs — be explicit, include exact commands, assume nothing.

**See `/docs/NAMING_REGISTRY.md` for the full anime character pool (70+ characters from Tom's completed list). When spinning up additional agents, pick the next unused name from the anime pool.**

### Extended Anime Roster (activate as needed)

**Vegeta (Monitoring):** "It's over 9000!" Threshold alerts, uptime checks, resource monitoring, performance metrics. Relentless about keeping numbers in range.
**Trunks (Migrations):** Time traveler — database migrations, schema changes, zero-downtime deploys, rollback procedures. Handles the transition between past and future states.
**Mikasa (Critical Protection):** Guards the database, the vault, the deploy pipeline. Verifies no single point of failure. "I will protect."
**Erwin (Strategic Planning):** Capacity planning, cost optimization, scaling decisions. Sees the big picture before committing resources.
**Mustang (Cleanup):** Controlled destruction — removes old deployments, rotates logs, purges stale resources, cleans up orphaned infrastructure. "Snap."
**Olivier (Hardening):** Fortress commander — firewall rules, SSH config, TLS setup, infrastructure hardening. Turns a server into Fort Briggs.
**Hughes (Observability):** Structured logs, trace IDs, error aggregation, distributed tracing setup. Makes the invisible visible. (We remember you, Hughes.)
**Calcifer (Daemon Management):** The fire that powers everything — process supervision, graceful restart, health checks, watchdog timers. Keeps the server alive.
**Duo (Teardown):** The God of Death — decommissions old infrastructure, deletes orphaned resources, handles clean shutdown of deprecated services.

### Child Process Sandboxing

When the application spawns child processes (workers, background jobs, PTY sessions, build scripts), verify they inherit appropriate restrictions:
- Environment variables: filter sensitive vars before passing to child (e.g., don't pass `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to user-spawned PTY sessions)
- Filesystem access: use systemd `ReadWritePaths`/`ProtectSystem` or equivalent to restrict write access
- Network access: child processes should not have broader network access than the parent
- Resource limits: set memory/CPU limits on spawned processes to prevent resource exhaustion

(Field report #57: shell profiles re-injected environment variables that were explicitly filtered from the PTY environment.)

## Goal

Deployable, observable, recoverable, maintainable. Automate everything done more than twice. Make deploys boring. Enable 3am debugging with just docs and a terminal.

## When to Call Other Agents

## Operating Rules

1. Automate what you do twice.
2. Boring is good.
3. Everything fails. Design for restart, rollback, restore.
4. Logs are your memory.
5. Least access.
6. Document the "why."
7. Cost-aware.
8. Immutable when possible.

## Sequence

**Senku — Provisioning:** `/scripts/provision.sh` — System updates, tools, runtime, database, Redis, reverse proxy, process manager, app user, firewall (22/80/443 only), fail2ban, log rotation, swap, unattended upgrades.

**Levi — Deployment:** `/scripts/deploy.sh` — Pull → Install (npm ci) → Generate ORM → Migrate → Build → Reload (zero-downtime PM2 cluster) → Health check → Auto-rollback on failure. `/scripts/rollback.sh` for manual rollback.

**PostgreSQL privilege revocation:** When setting up PostgreSQL with multiple roles: revoke from PUBLIC first, then grant to authorized roles. `REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_role;` Default PostgreSQL grants PUBLIC access to the public schema — this must be explicitly removed.

**htpasswd format:** For nginx basic auth, use `htpasswd -B` (bcrypt). The `apr1` (MD5) format has inconsistent support across nginx builds and platforms.

**Spike — Networking:** Reverse proxy (Caddy/Nginx) with HTTPS, gzip, security headers. SSL on all domains/subdomains. Auto-renewal. HSTS. DNS records. SPF/DKIM/DMARC for email.

**PM2 Config:** Web in cluster mode (≥2 instances). Workers in fork mode. Memory limits. Auto-start on reboot (`pm2 startup` + `pm2 save`). Log rotation.

**Docker Service Checklist (when docker-compose is the process manager):**
For each service in `docker-compose.yml`, verify:
1. **Logging driver** — `json-file` with `max-size` and `max-file` limits. Default Docker logging has no rotation — logs grow until disk fills.
2. **Volume mounts** — every persistent directory (uploads, data, logs) has an explicit volume. Container-only data is lost on `docker compose down`.
3. **Healthcheck** — `HEALTHCHECK` in Dockerfile or `healthcheck` in compose. Without it, Docker reports "running" even when the app has crashed.
4. **Resource limits** — `deploy.resources.limits` for memory and CPU. Start with `mem_limit: 512m` for web, `256m` for workers.
5. **Restart policy** — `restart: unless-stopped` for production. `restart: no` for one-off containers.
6. **Environment variables** — use `env_file`, never inline secrets. Verify `.env` is in `.dockerignore`.
7. **Dependency health** — `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy` (compose v2.1+). Without it, the app starts before its database is ready.
(Field report #280)

**Compose validation goes deeper than syntax (field report #352 #2).** `docker compose config` only validates *syntax* — it renders the merged YAML and exits 0 even when the resulting topology is wrong. Three failure modes it will not catch:

- **Dependency closure.** A service can reference a network, volume, or `depends_on` target whose definition exists but whose *startup* chain is broken. Check the closure with `docker compose up --dry-run` — it walks the full dependency graph and reports what would actually start (and in what order) without launching containers.
- **Overlay merge, not overlay replace.** Compose **merges** list-and-map fields like `depends_on` and `environment` across overlay files (`-f base.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml`); it does not replace them. The classic trap: `base.yml` declares `depends_on: [redis]` for development, and an overlay tries to drop it with `depends_on: []` — the empty list **merges into** the base list, the `redis` edge **survives**, and prod still waits on (or starts) a dev-only Redis. To *replace* rather than merge, use the override tags: `depends_on: !override []` (replace the whole list) or `!reset null` (remove the key entirely). Verify the rendered result with `docker compose config` and confirm the unwanted edge is actually gone — never assume the overlay won.
- **Render is not load.** `docker compose config` resolves env values into the rendered YAML but never executes the app's own runtime config validation (Zod/envalid/pydantic). A schema that throws on a value compose happily renders — the empty-string-into-`.url()` crash above (§Config Foot-Guns, field report #356) — exits 0 under `compose config` and only surfaces at container boot. Before deploying a config-affecting change, run the app's config loader against the prod env (`node -e "require('./dist/config')"`, `python -c "import app.config"`, or a dedicated `npm run config:check`), OR canary the config-loading worker (§Deploy sequence) so a boot crash surfaces off the serving path. Verify config LOADS, not just that it RENDERS. (Field report #356 #3.)

**L — Monitoring:** Health endpoint (/api/health checking DB, Redis, disk). External uptime monitor. Request logging (method, path, status, duration). Error tracking. Slow query logging (>1s). Worker job logging. Alerts: CPU >80%, Memory >85%, Disk >80%.

**Build Staleness Detection (health endpoint):** The health endpoint MUST include a build fingerprint check. At startup, capture a build fingerprint (git commit hash, `BUILD_HASH` env var, or entry bundle mtime). Include it in `/api/health` responses. After any deploy, compare the health endpoint's fingerprint against the expected value. A mismatch means the process serves stale code — the build completed but was never reloaded. Automate: if health fingerprint != deployed commit, trigger process reload. This is the #1 cause of "I deployed but nothing changed" incidents. (Field reports #278, #279)

**Bulma — Backup:** `/scripts/backup-db.sh` — Daily cron, compressed, off-site (R2/S3), 30-day retention. **Restore tested at least once.** RPO/RTO defined.

**Holo — Cost:** Monthly hosting, per-user cost, most expensive service, growth projections, right-sizing recommendations.

**Levi — Page Weight Gate (pre-deploy):** Before deploying, check total static asset size. Individual images must be < 200KB. Total `public/` or `static/` directory must be < 10MB (excluding node_modules and build cache). Flag images >4x their display dimensions — a 1024px source for a 40px avatar is a 97% bandwidth waste. If `/imagine` was used, verify Step 5.5 (Gimli optimization) ran. This gate catches the #1 cause of slow marketing sites.

**Levi — Platform Build Gate (pre-deploy):** For platform targets (Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Railway), run the framework build locally BEFORE pushing to the platform. `npm run build` (or equivalent) must succeed locally — platform build environments may use different Node/npm versions and stricter PostCSS settings. Common failures: Tailwind v4 scanning non-source directories (see Galadriel's content scanning check), TypeScript strict errors suppressed locally but caught in CI, missing env vars. For Vercel specifically: prefer `vercel --prebuilt` with local build output, or use preview deploys (`vercel` without `--prod`) before production. If the build fails on the platform but passes locally, check: Node version mismatch, PostCSS plugin versions, content scanning paths.

**Pin Node.js version:** Every project must have a `.node-version` file AND `engines.node` in package.json. Platform-managed environments (Vercel, Railway) auto-upgrade Node versions — silent failures when new Node breaks a dependency. Pin to the version used during development.

### Restart Resilience Checklist

Inventory all in-memory state and define what happens when the process restarts:

| State | Where | On Restart | Recovery |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Vault password | Module-scope variable | Lost | Prompt user to re-enter |
| Auth sessions | In-memory Map | Lost | Redirect to login |
| PTY sessions | In-memory Map | Killed | Show "session ended", offer retry |
| Provision locks | Module-scope boolean | Reset | Safe (allows new provisions) |
| Caches | In-memory objects | Cleared | Rebuild on next access |

For every entry: does the UI handle the "gone" state gracefully? Or does the user see a cryptic error? (Field report #30: "Vault is locked" with no recovery path.)

### Platform Networking Defaults

Bind to `::` (dual-stack) not `127.0.0.1` on localhost. macOS resolves `localhost` to `::1` (IPv6) before `127.0.0.1` (IPv4). Binding IPv4-only makes HTTP work (browser tries both) but WebSocket fails (only tries first resolution). The `::` address accepts both. (Field report #30: 1 hour to diagnose.)

### Tailwind v4 + Vercel Deployment

Known issues when deploying Tailwind v4 to Vercel or similar build platforms:
1. **Pin exact versions** — `tailwindcss@4.1.8` + `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.8`. Minor version mismatches cause build failures.
2. **Restrict source scanning** — Use `@source('../src')` to limit Tailwind's class extraction. Default scans ALL files including markdown method docs containing CSS-like tokens.
3. **Avoid `attr()` in CSS** — `attr(data-text)` is valid in browsers but PostCSS rejects it at build time. Use static content instead.
4. **CSS variables in `@keyframes`** — Valid in modern browsers but some CSS optimizers reject them. Test in the platform build environment, not just local dev.
5. **Always verify in the platform build** — `npm run build` locally ≠ platform build. Different PostCSS versions, stricter optimization passes. (Field report #29: 20 commits / 19% of project fighting one CSS deployment issue.)

### Don't Interleave Debugging with Syncs

Never combine methodology syncs (`/void`) with unrelated debugging in the same session. If a sync introduces a problem, the debug commits interleave with sync commits, making it impossible to identify which change broke what. Rule: sync first, verify, THEN debug separately. If needed, hard-reset to the pre-sync state and reapply incrementally. (Field report #29: 6 retcon commits interleaved with 20 CSS-fix commits.)

### Production Runtime Topology Authoritative-Source

Production runtime should run under a **single supervisor** — typically systemd, sometimes PM2 or Docker — and the active topology must be discoverable from one source. Temporary workarounds drift the topology silently:

- A `nohup`/`tmux`/manual `&` launch outlives its purpose; the systemd unit drifts from reality.
- `ExecStart` paths ossify against an old binary location (`~/.local/bin/uvicorn` vs `.venv/bin/uvicorn`).
- `StartLimitBurst` exhausts; the unit shows `failed` while a manual process serves traffic.

When a temporary workaround is acceptable, document it in `OPERATIONS.md` §Runtime Topology (or equivalent) as the canonical runtime, then either fix the systemd unit OR set a calendar reminder to revisit it. Field report #319 §7: Union Station served via nohup-launched uvicorn from 2026-03-27 onward — the systemd unit was `enabled` but `failed`. M-05 cutover required killing the nohup process (brief outage), fixing `ExecStart`, `systemctl reset-failed`, `daemon-reload`, `restart`. None of that should have been in the cutover contract.

**Pre-deploy check (mandatory):**

1. `systemctl status <unit>` (or `pm2 list`) — what does the supervisor think is running?
2. `ps -ef | grep <binary>` — what's actually running?
3. Reconcile. If they disagree, fix BEFORE the deploy starts.

### Process Manager Discipline

If a process manager (PM2, systemd, Docker, supervisord) owns the application port, NEVER kill the port directly (`fuser -k`, `kill`, `lsof -ti | xargs kill`). Always reload through the process manager: `pm2 reload`, `systemctl restart`, `docker compose restart`. Killing the port causes the process manager to auto-restart the old build, creating a race condition with any manual start attempt — the user sees stale code while the fix is already built. (Field report #123: 30+ minutes of stale code serving in production because `fuser -k 5005/tcp` raced with PM2's auto-restart.)

**Detection rule:** When writing CLAUDE.md "How to Run" sections or session restart commands, check if the project uses a process manager (`ecosystem.config.js`, `docker-compose.yml`, `*.service` files). If yes, the restart command MUST go through the PM — not through port killing.

### PM2 Operational Foot-guns

**`pm2 reload <config>` does NOT re-read log paths.** `error_file` / `out_file` paths bind at process *registration* time, not at reload time (field report #343 F9). If you change a log path in `ecosystem.config.js` and run `pm2 reload`, PM2 keeps writing to the old paths — the new ones never take effect, and a log-rotation or disk-pressure fix silently does nothing. Changing log paths requires a full re-registration cycle:
```bash
pm2 delete <app>           # drop the old registration
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --cwd /path/to/project
pm2 save                   # persist so the new paths survive reboot
```
The same applies to any other property that binds at registration (`exec_mode`, `instances`, `cwd`): `pm2 reload` reloads code, not the process definition.

**Multi-user deploy setups need per-user git identity (field report #343 F3).** When each environment runs as a different OS user (e.g. `deploy-staging`, `deploy-prod`), any git operation the deploy performs as that user — a merge commit, a `git stash`, a tag, an auto-commit of generated lockfiles — fails with `fatal: empty ident name (for <user@host>) not allowed` if that user has no `user.email` / `user.name`. The fault is invisible until a fallback path that commits actually runs in production. Provision git identity per deploy user:
```bash
sudo -u deploy-prod git config --global user.email "deploy@example.com"
sudo -u deploy-prod git config --global user.name  "Prod Deploy"
```
Add this to `provision.sh` for every Unix user that will run git as part of a deploy or fallback path.

### Deploy-Strategy Nomenclature Check

If a deploy script's comments or docs claim **blue-green** or **zero-downtime**, verify the code actually implements an atomic-swap mechanism before believing the label (field report #343 F7). A real zero-downtime swap is one of:

- **temp-build-then-rename** — build into `release-new/`, then `mv release-new release` (or repoint a `current` symlink) in a single atomic operation,
- **container swap** — start the new container, health-check it, then cut traffic over and stop the old one, or
- **load-balancer cutover** — add the new instance to the pool, drain and remove the old one.

A `stop → build → start` loop mislabeled "blue-green" serves nothing during the build window and produces a 502 gap on every deploy. The label is not the mechanism. Audit check: grep the deploy script for the claim, then confirm a rename/symlink-repoint, container cutover, or LB pool change exists. If it's a stop-build-start loop, either fix it to atomic-swap or correct the comment — a mislabeled strategy hides a recurring outage.

### CI runs `npm test` at repo root

In monorepo CI workflows, run `npm test` at the repository root — NOT `npm run test -w <workspace-name>`. The workspace-scoped form skips the root `pretest` hook, silently bypassing any root-level validators (agent-ref checkers, gate tests, consistency checks).

Evidence: field report #308 RC-3 — the `stat -f %m` portability bug in surfer-gate was latent for multiple releases because CI used `npm test -w @voidforge/cli`, which bypassed the root pretest that ran gate tests. Surfaced only when v23.9.0 switched CI to root `npm test`. See LRN-8 in docs/LEARNINGS.md.

### Post-push live-URL fingerprint (platform auto-deploy integrity)

The health-endpoint build-fingerprint (above) catches processes serving stale code. It does NOT catch the case where the platform auto-deploy integration is broken and no new deploy happened at all. To catch that:

After every `git push` to a branch that auto-deploys, wait ~60 seconds, then hit a known endpoint on the live URL. Compare a content fingerprint (a string from the just-pushed commit, or the `last-modified` header age) against expected. If the fingerprint didn't change, the auto-deploy integration is broken — run the platform-specific manual deploy (`vercel --prod`, `flyctl deploy`, `wrangler pages deploy ./dist`, `firebase deploy`, etc.) and flag the hook as needing reconnection.

Evidence: field report #307 — voidforge-marketing-site Vercel auto-deploy silently failed for 8 days after the repo was renamed (`voidforge-marketing-site` → `voidforge-site`). Eight days of unbuilt pushes went live as April-15 stale content until a `/assess` caught it. A post-push fingerprint check would have caught it on day one.

Canonical check snippet (note: `Last-Modified` header is optional on some CDNs — fallback is the content-hash grep on the second line):
```bash
EXPECTED_SHA="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
sleep 60
FINGERPRINT="$(curl -sI https://$DEPLOY_URL | grep -i '^last-modified:')"
if [[ -z "$FINGERPRINT" ]] || ! curl -s https://$DEPLOY_URL | grep -q "$EXPECTED_SHA"; then
  echo "AUTO-DEPLOY FAILED — running manual deploy"
  # platform-specific manual deploy here
fi
```

Applies to: Vercel Git Integration, Cloudflare Pages Git Integration, Netlify Git Integration, Firebase web-hook auto-deploys.

### The served artifact is not the built artifact

Every step exiting 0 — `git pull` ✓, `npm run build` ✓, `pm2 reload` / `docker compose up` ✓ — proves the build *ran*; it does NOT prove the **served** bundle is the one you just built (field report #349 F-1). The two can diverge whenever the thing that builds and the thing that serves are different processes pointed at different paths. The canonical split: a **host nginx static root** serves `/var/www/app/dist`, while the build runs *inside a Docker container* and writes to a **container-internal `dist`** that the host root never sees. Build succeeds, container restarts clean, health check is green — and prod serves the previous bundle indefinitely because nginx is reading a directory nobody rebuilt.

Rule: after deploy, confirm the SERVED bundle matches the BUILT one by **fingerprint fetched back through the public/served path** — not by exit codes. Capture a build fingerprint (git short SHA, `BUILD_HASH`, or the hashed entry-bundle filename) at build time, then fetch it back through the real serving path and assert equality:
```bash
EXPECTED="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
# Pull the fingerprint through the SERVED path — the public URL or the host static root,
# whichever end users actually hit — never the build directory.
SERVED="$(curl -s "https://$DEPLOY_URL/version.txt")"   # or grep the hashed main.<hash>.js from index.html
[ "$SERVED" = "$EXPECTED" ] || { echo "SERVED ARTIFACT MISMATCH: served=$SERVED built=$EXPECTED"; exit 1; }
```

This **generalizes to manual `/deploy`** the two automated checks already in this doc: **Build Staleness Detection** (§health endpoint — the process serves stale code) catches a build-but-no-reload within one process, and **Post-push live-URL fingerprint** (§above) catches a broken platform auto-deploy. This entry is the same fingerprint discipline for the self-hosted, multi-location, hand-run deploy: assert the served fingerprint equals the built fingerprint as the final gate of any manual deploy, not just platform pushes.

### Methodology-exposure check (static-host deploys)

After deploying to a static CDN (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, S3+CloudFront), curl a known methodology path and assert 404 / denied:

```bash
for path in /.claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md /docs/methods/FORGE_KEEPER.md /HOLOCRON.md /CHANGELOG.md /VERSION.md; do
  status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://$DEPLOY_URL$path")
  [[ "$status" == "200" ]] && echo "LEAK: $path returned $status"
done
```

If any path returns 200, add a `.cfignore` / `.vercelignore` / `firebase.json ignore` entry that excludes `.claude/`, `docs/methods/`, `docs/patterns/`, `HOLOCRON.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION.md`, `logs/`. Methodology files must not be publicly served.

Evidence: field report #303 — saltwater.com was serving 264 agent files, 37 patterns, method docs, HOLOCRON, CHANGELOG, and VERSION publicly on its Cloudflare CDN. Affects every VoidForge-generated project deployed to a static host until an ignore file is added. Companion: FORGE_KEEPER.md §Deployment Hygiene.

## E2E CI Architecture

E2E tests run as a separate CI job, parallel with unit tests. Browser binaries cached via `actions/cache` (GitHub Actions) or equivalent CI cache. E2E failures are informational for the first release (v18.0-v18.1), then enforced as blocking. Playwright uses Chromium only in CI to minimize binary size (~250MB cached). Configuration:

- **Job isolation (scoped to the unit gate):** E2E job runs independently from the unit test job — a flaky E2E test never blocks the *unit* gate. This isolation is correct ONLY for the unit gate. Isolating E2E from the unit gate is right; excluding it from the *publish* gate is not (see Publish gate alignment below)
- **Browser cache:** Cache `~/.cache/ms-playwright` (Linux) or `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` (macOS) between runs. Key on Playwright version from `package-lock.json`
- **Retry policy:** Failed E2E tests retry once in CI before reporting failure (catches transient timing issues)
- **Artifacts:** On failure, upload Playwright trace files and screenshots as CI artifacts for debugging
- **Enforcement timeline:** v18.0-v18.1 informational only (report but don't block). v18.2+ E2E failures block merge.

### Publish gate alignment

Isolating the E2E job from the *unit* gate is correct; excluding it from the *publish* gate is not. The tag-push publish workflow must depend on the **full validation suite — E2E and a11y included**, not unit tests alone. Wire the dependency one of two ways:

- **`needs:`** — the publish job declares `needs: [test, e2e, a11y]` so it cannot run until every validation job passes on the same run, OR
- **same-SHA `workflow_run`** — the publish workflow triggers on `workflow_run` completion of the validation workflow and re-checks the SHA, refusing to publish unless the full suite went green on that exact commit.

A publish workflow with `needs: [test]` (unit only) is structurally blind to E2E and a11y regressions: tag-push arms the irreversible npm publish, and a green unit gate ships a broken bundle. (Field report #363 F4 — this session: `publish.yml` had `needs: [test]` and no dependency on the `e2e` job, so an `aria-required-children` regression shipped while the e2e/a11y job was red.)

### Chronically-Red Check Policy

A CI check that is red across **≥2 consecutive releases** is not "known-flaky background noise" — it is a blind spot, and it MUST be resolved into exactly one of three dispositions (no fourth):

1. **Fixed** — the underlying failure is repaired and the check goes green.
2. **Converted to informational** — `continue-on-error: true` (or the CI equivalent) PLUS a comment linking a tracking issue. A muted check with no tracking issue is not a disposition.
3. **Removed** — the check is deleted from the workflow if it no longer earns its keep.

Kusanagi flags any release whose CI carries a check red across the **prior two releases** with no recorded disposition. (Field report #363 F4 — this session: a chronically-red `validate-branches` check sat ignored for ~2 months and hid an `aria-required-children` regression that shipped, because `publish.yml` had no dependency on the e2e job that would have caught it.)

## Deploy Automation (`/deploy` command)

The `/deploy` command automates the build-deploy-verify cycle. Kusanagi leads, Levi executes, L monitors, Valkyrie handles rollback.

### Target Detection

Read `deploy:` from PRD frontmatter. If absent, scan for evidence:
- `vercel.json` / `.vercel/` → Vercel
- `railway.json` / `railway.toml` → Railway
- `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml` → Docker
- `SSH_HOST` in .env or vault → VPS/EC2
- `wrangler.toml` → Cloudflare Workers/Pages

### Deploy State

Maintain `/logs/deploy-state.md` after every deploy:
```markdown
Last deployed: 2026-03-22T12:00:00Z
Version: v2.9.0
Commit: abc123
Target: vps (dialog.travel)
Status: healthy
Health check: 200 OK (142ms)
```

The Danger Room's deploy panel reads this file. The drift detector compares `deploy-state.md` commit against `git rev-parse HEAD`.

### Campaign Integration

- **At campaign end (Step 6):** After Victory Gauntlet + debrief, prompt: "Deploy to [target]? [Y/n]". In `--blitz` mode: auto-deploy.
- **On `/git --deploy`:** Auto-deploy after commit. Levi runs the full deploy cycle.
- **Standalone:** `/deploy` runs independently for ad-hoc deploys.

### Rollback Protocol (Valkyrie)

If health check fails after deploy:
1. **VPS:** `git checkout HEAD~1 && npm ci && npm run build && pm2 restart`
2. **Vercel:** `vercel rollback`
3. **Docker:** restart previous container image
4. Re-run health check on rolled-back version
5. Log rollback to deploy-state.md with timestamp and reason
6. Alert: "Deploy failed. Rolled back to previous version. See deploy-state.md for details."

(Field report #97: 3 campaigns of Dialog Travel code never reached production because no deploy step existed.)

## Load Testing (Pre-Launch)

**When to load test:**
- Before first production launch with expected traffic >100 req/s
- After significant architecture changes (new database, new caching layer, new API gateway)
- Before scaling events (marketing launch, Product Hunt, press coverage)

**What to test:**
- Target: the slowest API endpoint at 2x expected peak traffic
- Measure: p50, p95, p99 latency; error rate; connection pool saturation; memory usage
- Duration: sustained load for 5+ minutes (not just burst)

**Tools (pick one):**
- **k6** (Grafana) — scriptable, CI-friendly, TypeScript support
- **Artillery** — YAML config, good for API testing
- **ab** (Apache Bench) — quick and dirty, already installed on most systems
- **wrk** — high-performance HTTP benchmarking

**What to look for:**
- p95 latency >500ms under load → database query optimization needed
- Error rate >1% → connection pool exhaustion or resource limits
- Memory climbing without leveling → memory leak
- CPU at 100% on a single core → event loop blocking (Node.js)

**Load testing is NOT a VoidForge automation.** VoidForge tells you to do it and what to look for. The actual test requires infrastructure and traffic generation tools that are project-specific.

## Build Output Protection

**Deploy safety: backup build output before running build.** Before running `npm run build`, `next build`, or equivalent, backup the existing build output directory (`.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`). If the build fails, restore the backup so the previous working build can still be served. Pattern: `cp -r .next .next.bak && npm run build || (rm -rf .next && mv .next.bak .next && echo "Build failed, restored previous build" && exit 1)`. A failed build that destroys the previous working output means zero deployable code until the build is fixed. (Triage fix from field report batch #149-#153.)

**PM2 discipline: never `pm2 delete` + `pm2 start` without `--cwd`.** Always specify the working directory explicitly: `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --cwd /path/to/project`. Without `--cwd`, PM2 resolves paths relative to the current shell directory, which may differ from the project root — especially in deploy scripts that `cd` between operations. A `pm2 start` from the wrong directory silently starts the process with wrong paths, serving 404s on every route. (Triage fix from field report batch #149-#153.)

### Docker Cleanup Preflight

Before any `rm -rf` against a Docker **bind-mount** path (volumes the container wrote to as root — pgdata, redis dumps, uploaded files), preflight the ownership; do not just run the delete and hope (field report #353 RC-003). Docker bind-mounts written by a container default to **root** ownership on the host, so an unprivileged agent's `rm -rf` fails partway with `Permission denied`, often after deleting the writable half of the tree — a worse state than not starting.

Preflight: `stat` the path's owner first, and branch on it:
```bash
target=/var/lib/myapp/pgdata
owner="$(stat -c %U "$target" 2>/dev/null || stat -f %Su "$target")"   # GNU || BSD/macOS
if [ "$owner" = "root" ] && [ "$(id -u)" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "MANUAL STEP REQUIRED — $target is root-owned; run as operator:"
  echo "    sudo rm -rf $target"
else
  rm -rf "$target"
fi
```
When the path is root-owned and the agent is unprivileged, **emit the `sudo`-prefixed step as a MANUAL operator action** rather than attempting (and half-completing) the delete. A clean handoff beats a partial destruction. (`stat -c %U` is GNU coreutils; `stat -f %Su` is BSD/macOS — the snippet tries both for portability.)

### Pre-Build Disk Preflight (single-host Docker targets)

Before any `docker build` on a single-host target, check free space on the build filesystem — `npm ci` + `next build` + image export need headroom, and the export step fails at the very end with `no space left on device` after the whole build has run (~10 min wasted). SHA-tagged deploy images accumulate (e.g. 7 x ~1.5 GB) and silently consume the root volume. Preflight: `AVAIL=$(df -P /var/lib/docker | awk "NR==2{print \$4}")` (KB). If below a threshold (e.g. <8 GB, sized to image + build cache), do NOT just abort — offer remediation: (1) `docker builder prune -f` to clear build cache, (2) remove stale `app:<oldsha>` tags KEEPING the current rollback tag — `docker images --format "{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}" | grep "^app:" | grep -v -e ":latest" -e ":$ROLLBACK_SHA" | tail -n +3 | xargs -r docker rmi`. Re-check space, then build. Never auto-delete the rollback image. Evidence: field report #357 #1 — `docker build` failed at image export with host root at 96%; recovery freed ~11 GB.

## Multi-Environment Isolation

When staging and production coexist on the same server, enforce full isolation:

1. **Separate Unix users** — never share group membership with the production user. `id staging-user | grep prod-group` must return empty.
2. **Separate credentials** — different API keys, database users, Redis passwords per environment. Verify: `grep API_KEY prod/.env staging/.env | md5sum` produces different hashes.
3. **Separate storage** — different R2/S3 bucket names, different upload directories. Shared buckets allow staging to corrupt production data.
4. **Redis auth** — `requirepass` mandatory. DB number separation (0 vs 1) is insufficient alone — any client can `SELECT` any DB without auth.
5. **Git worktree model** — staging branch locked to a worktree directory. Development happens on `main` locally. Deploy to staging with `git push origin main:staging`. Never `git checkout staging` from the main work directory — worktrees prevent this by design.
6. **Git hooks** — pre-push hook blocks direct push to production branch without staging verification. A `promote.sh` script handles staging → production promotion after health check.
7. **Docker port audit** — Docker port bindings (`-p`) create iptables rules that bypass UFW entirely. Verify with `ss -tlnp` or `docker ps --format '{{.Ports}}'`, not `ufw status`. All ports should bind to `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0`.
8. **Staging-first deploy flow** — `/deploy` and `/git` should detect staging branches and push there first. Production deploy requires explicit `--prod` flag or promotion from staging.

Convention isn't enough — enforcement is. The pre-push hook is the single most effective protection. (Field report #241: 68-hour production outage from shared infrastructure.)

### Renaming a Linked Worktree Directory Breaks Git Silently

A linked git worktree (staging worktree, release worktree) keeps **two** pointer files that must agree on the directory's path. Renaming the worktree directory with a plain `mv` orphans both, and git gives you no warning (field report #343 F2):

1. The worktree's own `.git` **file** (not a directory — it contains `gitdir: /abs/path/to/main/.git/worktrees/<name>`).
2. The main repo's `.git/worktrees/<name>/gitdir` file, which points back at the worktree's `.git` file.

After a bare `mv staging staging-old`, both paths are stale. The worst part: **`git worktree list` does NOT warn** — it happily prints the old path, so the breakage is invisible until a git command inside the moved worktree fails with `fatal: not a git repository` or a deploy that `cd`s into the worktree silently operates on the wrong tree.

Fix — never `mv` a worktree directory. Use the porcelain that updates both pointers atomically:
```bash
git worktree move staging /new/abs/path/staging-old
```
If a directory was already moved by hand, repair both pointers manually:
```bash
# 1. fix the worktree's own .git file
echo "gitdir: /abs/main/.git/worktrees/staging" > /new/abs/path/staging-old/.git
# 2. fix the main repo's back-pointer
echo "/new/abs/path/staging-old/.git" > /abs/main/.git/worktrees/staging/gitdir
git worktree repair /new/abs/path/staging-old   # validates both ends
```
`git worktree repair` is the belt-and-suspenders step — run it after any manual edit to confirm both ends resolve.

## Deploy Safety Rules

**rsync exclusion mandate:** NEVER use `rsync --delete` without excluding VPS-only directories. User-uploaded files, generated avatars, and data files only exist on the VPS — `--delete` will destroy them. Mandatory exclusions:
```
--exclude node_modules --exclude .next --exclude .git
--exclude .env --exclude .ssh
--exclude public/avatars --exclude public/uploads --exclude data/
```
Add project-specific exclusions for any directory that receives runtime-generated content. (Field report #103: `rsync --delete` destroyed 250 VPS-only avatar files.)

**Build artifact freshness:** Before deploying, verify that compiled output (`dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`) is newer than source. Compare timestamps: `find src/ -name '*.ts' -newer dist/index.js` (adapt for your build). If source is newer than dist, rebuild before deploying. A stale build artifact deploys old code that passes all source-level tests. Automate this in the deploy script: if stale, run the build command automatically. (Field report #263: `dist/workers/index.js` was stale — 4 new worker registrations missing, cron jobs never fired in production for ~5 days.)

**Credential pre-flight:** Before any deploy, verify: (1) SSH_HOST is set, (2) SSH key file exists, (3) SSH test connection succeeds (`ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5`). If any check fails, abort — do not attempt deploy with missing credentials. Check `~/.voidforge/deploys/` and `~/.voidforge/projects.json` for historical credential data if `.env` is missing values.

**VCS config is a secret surface.** Treat `.git/config` like `.env`. An inline-token HTTPS remote (`https://user:TOKEN@github.com/...`) stores a live credential in plaintext and prints it on every `git remote -v` — into CI logs, deploy output, and screen-shares. Before deploy/CI runs, scan it: `grep -E 'https://[^/@]+:[^@]+@' .git/config`. Prefer SSH remotes (`git@github.com:owner/repo.git`) or a credential helper (`git config --global credential.helper`) over inline-token HTTPS — these keep the token out of `.git/config` and out of every remote op. If an inline token is found, rotate it and `git remote set-url` to SSH or a helper-backed URL. (Field report #361; companion: SECURITY_AUDITOR.md Phase-1 git-remote scan.)

**Type-check pre-flight:** Before any deploy, run `npx tsc --noEmit` (TypeScript) or equivalent type-checker. Deploy scripts must not proceed if type-checking fails. This catches errors that `npm run build` sometimes ignores (e.g., route params, config properties). Three consecutive deploy failures from catchable type errors is three too many. (Field report #299)

**Deploy target verification:** Before deploying to any platform (Vercel, Cloudflare, Netlify, etc.), verify the deploy target matches the intended production environment. If the project has multiple environments (preview, staging, production) or non-default production branches, use explicit flags (`--branch=main`, `--prod`). Never rely on default branch inference — it can silently deploy to the wrong environment. (Field report #114: 3 deploys to the wrong Vercel environment because the default branch was "main" but production was mapped to a different branch.)

**First deployment checklist (field report #147):** The first deploy of any project has a category of bugs that subsequent deploys don't — missing runtime deps, wrong env var names, missing directories, health check timeouts. Before declaring the first deploy successful, verify: (1) Process manager (PM2, gunicorn, systemd) is installed and running, (2) All env vars from `.env` are loaded by the app (not just present in the file), (3) Log directory exists and is writable, (4) Health endpoint responds within the configured timeout, (5) Docker entrypoint CMD runs the correct file (not a legacy entrypoint).

**Email deliverability verification:** If the project sends email (transactional, auth, notifications), verify delivery works end-to-end after deploy: (1) Check that the sending domain has DNS records configured in the email provider (SPF, DKIM, domain verification). An API key alone is not enough — unverified domains silently fail with 403. (2) Send a test email via the provider's API (e.g., `curl` or SDK call) and confirm a 200 response. (3) If using a custom FROM domain, verify it matches the verified domain — mismatches cause silent rejection. Email that fails silently is invisible until a user reports "I never got the verification email." (Field report #259: Resend API key existed, templates existed, but sending domain was never verified in DNS — all emails silently 403'd for 2 weeks of production.)

**Live-fire verification per credential (field report #360).** After wiring ANY external credential — analytics, error tracking, ad platform, payment, LLM provider, anything with an API key/secret/token — exercise it against the provider's LIVE API and confirm acceptance before marking the integration done. Env-var-set is NOT done; a structurally-valid value (correct prefix/length) can still be dead. Send the smallest real authenticated request the provider supports (a no-op read, a token introspection, a `whoami`/`accounts:list`, a single test event) and assert a success status, not just a non-error transport. This single live call also surfaces latent integration bugs the stored value can't reveal: a hardcoded/sunsetting API version now returning 404 (pin a current version + add a health check), a missing required header (e.g. `login-customer-id` for a manager→client account), or wrong scopes. Evidence: a Google Ads credential that looked structurally valid was dead (`invalid_client`) and a v17 pin had been retired (404, current v21) — eyeballing would have shipped a silently-broken integration.

**Post-deploy OAuth sign-in failures: discriminate IdP-side from regression before rolling back.** When the first real sign-in after a deploy fails, do NOT reflexively roll back — first locate WHERE it failed. If the error page lives on the IdP's own domain (e.g. `accounts.google.com/info/unknownerror`, with a `rapt` re-auth token) and occurs BEFORE your `/callback` is hit, the failure is on the identity provider, not your migration — typically a stuck re-auth session, not a regression. Confirm your authorize request was well-formed (client_id, redirect_uri, scope, state) and then retry in a fresh/incognito session; an incognito success proves the deploy is fine and the IdP session was transient. Only an error AT your callback (state mismatch, token-exchange 4xx, cookie not set) implicates your code. A reflexive rollback on an IdP-side error falsely blames the migration and fixes nothing. (Field report #357 #3.)

**Post-deploy asset verification:** After deploying, verify specifically the files that *changed* in this deploy — not pre-existing assets. Check: (a) correct content-type header (text/html on a static asset means the file is missing from the deployment), (b) correct content-length (not the index.html fallback size), (c) deployment list shows the correct environment. Do NOT verify only pre-existing assets — they prove the host is up, not that the deploy succeeded. (Field report #114)

**Read back after a vendor PUT that doesn't echo the object.** When a deploy or config step `PUT`s to a vendor/control-plane API (DNS provider, CDN, Plex, a SaaS settings endpoint) and the response does **not** contain the mutated object, do NOT treat the `200` as confirmation — issue a follow-up `GET` and assert the field you set actually took (field report #353 RC-004). A vendor `PUT` can return `200 OK` while silently discarding body params it doesn't recognize, applies asynchronously, or rejects at a validation layer that still returns success (the Plex pattern: settings PUT returns 200 but the value is unchanged). The status code confirms the request was *received*, not that the *mutation persisted*. Rule: for any non-echoing PUT/PATCH on the deploy path, follow with a read-back and compare before declaring success.

## Env-File Loading Safety

**NEVER load `.env` files with eval-export.** The pattern `while read line; do eval "export $line"; done < .env` (and `export $(cat .env | xargs)`) routes every value through the shell's positional-parameter and command expansion. Any secret containing a literal `$` — bcrypt hashes (`$2b$12$...`), PHP-style hashes, JWT signing keys, some base64 — gets mangled: `$2b` and `$12` are expanded as positional parameters and silently substituted (usually to empty), corrupting the secret. The app then boots with a broken hash and rejects every login, or signs tokens with a truncated key. The failure is invisible until auth breaks in production (field report #344 F1).

Use a `$`-safe literal parser that never re-evaluates the value:
```bash
# Safe: read the line verbatim, split on the FIRST '=' only, no expansion.
while IFS='=' read -r key val; do
  case "$key" in
    ''|'#'*) continue ;;          # skip blanks and comments
  esac
  export "$key=$val"               # value is a literal string, never eval'd
done < .env
```
`$`-safe alternatives that bypass the shell entirely:

- **Node ≥20:** `node --env-file=.env app.js` — Node parses the file itself, no shell expansion.
- **systemd:** `EnvironmentFile=/etc/myapp/app.env` in the unit — systemd reads values literally.
- **Docker Compose:** `env_file: .env` — Compose reads the file directly (it does NOT eval).

Audit existing deploy scripts: grep for `eval "export`, `eval export`, and `export $(cat`. Any hit is a latent secret-corruption bug — replace it with the literal parser or one of the runtime-native loaders above.

## Deploy-Environment Assumptions

A deploy that succeeds in dev can fail in prod because the *environment* differs in ways no syntax check sees. Three classes recur; two already have their own sections in this doc — this section adds the third and cross-references the others so they're triaged together:

1. **Served-artifact verification** — the bundle nginx/the CDN actually serves can diverge from the one you just built. See §The served artifact is not the built artifact and §Post-push live-URL fingerprint.
2. **`.env`-file precedence / loading** — values get mangled or silently defaulted depending on how the file is loaded. See §Env-File Loading Safety and §Config Foot-Guns (deploy/runtime).
3. **Boot-time schema re-application under DB-role ownership mismatch** (field report #354 F4) — the new one, below.

### Boot-time DDL ownership/grant alignment (field report #354 F4)

Idempotent boot-time DDL is NOT automatically safe across environments. When an app runs schema re-application at startup — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, or a migration runner invoked on boot — the `IF NOT EXISTS` guard only protects against *existence* collisions. It does NOT protect against *ownership* collisions. If the tables were originally created by a **different DB role** than the role the app connects as (the classic split: a privileged `admin`/`migrator` role created the schema, but the app connects as a least-privilege `app` role), the startup DDL fails:

- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` on an existing table the connecting role does not own can still raise `must be owner of table <name>` when it tries to reconcile constraints/indexes — `IF NOT EXISTS` short-circuits creation but not every ownership-checked path.
- `ALTER TABLE` / `CREATE INDEX` in the same boot sequence have no `IF NOT EXISTS` escape and fail outright with `permission denied` or `must be owner of relation`.
- The app then either crashes at boot or (worse) logs the DDL error and serves with a half-migrated schema.

This passes in dev because dev usually runs everything as one superuser-ish role, so ownership is never split. Prod splits roles for least privilege — and that's exactly where the ownership mismatch surfaces.

**The check (run before declaring a boot-time-migration deploy healthy):** confirm the role the app connects as either *owns* the schema objects or has been granted the privileges the boot DDL needs. For PostgreSQL:
```sql
-- Who owns the tables the app's boot DDL will touch?
SELECT tablename, tableowner FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
-- The connecting app role:
SELECT current_user;
```
If owner ≠ app role, align ownership or grants before the boot runs:
```sql
-- Option A: hand ownership to the app role (simplest when the app owns its own migrations)
ALTER TABLE public.<table> OWNER TO app_role;
-- Option B: keep a separate migrator owner, but grant the app role what its boot DDL needs,
--           and make future objects inherit grants:
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_role;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO app_role;
```
Prefer **Option A** when the app owns its migrations, **Option B** when policy requires a distinct migrator/owner role. Either way: idempotent DDL still needs ownership/grant alignment — the `IF NOT EXISTS` keyword is not an ownership escape hatch. Best practice is to run migrations as the owning role on deploy and connect the app as a least-privilege role that does NOT re-run DDL at boot at all — but if boot-time re-application stays, this alignment check is mandatory.

## systemd Unit Hardening (Node.js)

Sandboxing directives in a systemd unit are good practice, but **Node.js units must NOT set `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true`** (field report #344 F3). V8's JIT compiler maps pages that are simultaneously writable and executable (W^X is violated by design for JIT); `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true` (MDWE) forbids exactly that, so the Node process dies with **`SIGTRAP` at boot** before it serves a single request. The crash looks unrelated to the unit file — operators chase the app for hours.

Safe Node hardening stanza — everything useful **except** MDWE:
```ini
[Service]
# --- hardening (Node-safe) ---
NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectSystem=full
ProtectHome=true
PrivateTmp=true
PrivateDevices=true
ProtectKernelTunables=true
ProtectKernelModules=true
ProtectControlGroups=true
RestrictSUIDSGID=true
RestrictRealtime=true
LockPersonality=true
# MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true   # <-- DO NOT: V8 JIT needs W+X pages; SIGTRAP at boot
ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/myapp /var/log/myapp
```
Note: ahead-of-time-compiled binaries (Go, Rust, statically compiled C/C++) have no JIT and **can** keep `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true` — the restriction is specific to JIT runtimes (Node/V8, the JVM, PyPy, .NET with JIT). When a unit template is shared across services, gate MDWE on the runtime, not on the unit boilerplate.

## Config Foot-Guns (deploy/runtime)

Four recurring config traps that pass every syntax check yet break at runtime (field report #352 #5):

- **Empty-string env defaults are non-nullish.** A shell default of the form `${VAR:-}` (or a Compose `VAR: ""`) sets the variable to `""`, which is a *defined, non-null* value. Downstream `cfg.X = process.env.VAR ?? defaultX` then keeps `""` — nullish coalescing (`??`) only fires on `null`/`undefined`, never on empty string — so the intended default is silently poisoned and the app runs with an empty config value. Either leave the var truly unset (omit the `:-` default) or validate-and-coerce empty strings at the config boundary.
- **Dev hostnames hardcoded in worker healthchecks false-fail in prod.** A worker healthcheck that pings `http://localhost:3000` or `redis://dev-redis` passes in dev and fails in prod, marking a healthy worker unhealthy (and triggering restart loops). Healthcheck targets must come from the same env config the worker uses, never literals.
- **Awaiting best-effort side effects on the auth path blocks sign-in.** `await analytics.track(...)` / `await auditLog.write(...)` inline in the login handler means a slow or down telemetry backend stalls — or fails — the sign-in. Best-effort side effects must be fire-and-forget (queue them, `void`-them, or move them off the request path), never `await`ed on a latency-critical auth route.
- **A strict-validated OPTIONAL env crashes at boot on the empty string compose forwards.** This is the empty-string trap one level deeper than the `??` case above. A new *optional* var forwarded through compose as `${VAR:-}` (or `VAR: ""`) reaches the app as `""`, not absent. A schema of the form `z.string().url().optional()` does NOT save you: `.optional()` only admits `undefined`, so `""` is treated as a present value and handed to `.url()` (or `.email()`, or an enum), which rejects it — config throws at module load and the worker crash-loops (health 500, prod outage). Forwarding the var in `x-prod-env` is necessary but not sufficient; the validator must tolerate what `${VAR:-}` actually produces. Normalize `'' -> undefined` BEFORE the strict check: `z.preprocess(v => (v === "" ? undefined : v), z.string().url().optional())`. Apply to every optional var carrying a strict format (URL, email, enum, regex). (Field report #356 #1.)

## Subdomain Routing (Cloudflare Pages / Vercel / Netlify)

Platform-hosted static sites serve the entire project from root. Subdomain-to-subdirectory routing (e.g., `labs.example.com` → `/labs/`) requires platform-specific configuration:

- **Cloudflare Pages:** `_redirects` does NOT support host-based rules (unlike Netlify). Use a **Pages Function middleware** that: (a) checks `url.hostname`, (b) rewrites ONLY the root path to the subdirectory index using `context.env.ASSETS.fetch()` for transparent rewrite, (c) passes all other requests through unchanged. The subdirectory HTML MUST use **absolute paths** — relative paths like `./style.css` break because the browser resolves them relative to the rewritten URL (`/`), not the filesystem path (`/labs/`). (Field report #120: 5 commits to get this right.)
- **Vercel:** `vercel.json` rewrites with host conditions OR separate project per subdomain.
- **Netlify:** `_redirects` with host conditions (Netlify DOES support `https://hostname/*` syntax, unlike CF Pages).

**Subdomain cross-navigation rule:** When two sites share a codebase but serve on different domains (e.g., `example.com` and `labs.example.com`), ALL cross-navigation links must use full absolute URLs (`https://example.com/page`). Relative paths and bare `/` paths resolve to whichever domain the browser is currently on — `<a href="/">` on `labs.example.com` goes to `labs.example.com/`, not `example.com/`. (Field report #120)

**Always test routing before announcing a subdomain.** Curl the subdomain and verify it serves the expected content, not the root index.html.

## Cloudflare TLS Mode (Flexible vs Full/Strict)

On a **Flexible** TLS zone, Cloudflare terminates TLS at the edge and talks to the origin over **plain HTTP**. If that origin then **301-redirects HTTP → HTTPS** (the near-universal nginx/Caddy default), it bounces the edge's HTTP request back to HTTPS, which Cloudflare re-fetches over HTTP, which redirects again — an **infinite redirect loop** (`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`) for every visitor (field report #344 F4a). On a Flexible zone the origin must serve the app on plain HTTP and must NOT force the HTTPS upgrade — let Cloudflare own the HTTPS edge.

**A Let's Encrypt cert on a sibling host is NOT proof the zone is Full/Strict.** Operators see `https://api.example.com` with a valid LE cert and assume the apex is Full mode too — but TLS mode is per-zone (sometimes per-host with config-rule overrides), and a working cert elsewhere says nothing about the mode applied to *this* hostname. Don't infer the mode from a neighbor's cert; check it.

**Behavioral check — count redirect hops, don't read config:**
```bash
# Healthy Full/Strict origin: 0–1 hops. A Flexible-loop origin spirals (curl caps at --max-redirs).
curl -sIL --max-redirs 10 "http://$ORIGIN_HOST/" | grep -ci '^location:'
```
A count at or near the cap (or `curl: (47) Maximum (10) redirects followed`) is the Flexible-loop signature. Fix by either switching the zone to **Full (strict)** and keeping the origin's HTTPS redirect, OR keeping **Flexible** and removing the origin's HTTP→HTTPS 301. Pick one; don't mix.

**Minimum Cloudflare API token scope for `/deploy`.** So `/deploy` can verify the zone's SSL mode *before* it writes an nginx config that adds a redirect (and thus before it can create the loop), the deploy token must include **`Zone → SSL and Certificates → Read`** (`Zone:SSL`) and **`Zone → Certificates → Read`** (field report #344 F4b). With those scopes the deploy step queries the zone's `ssl` setting, and only emits a redirect-bearing origin config when the mode is Full/Strict. A token scoped to DNS-only cannot see the SSL mode and will happily ship a redirect into a Flexible zone.

## Deploy Surface Boundary

**Invariant:** the repository root is NEVER the deploy surface. Physical separation between "all files tracked in the repo" and "files uploaded to the CDN / server" is enforced by tool configuration, not by `.gitignore`.

Why this matters: most deploy tools (wrangler Direct Upload, `aws s3 sync`, Firebase `firebase deploy --only hosting`) do NOT honor `.gitignore`. Deploying from repo root uploads `.env`, `.claude/`, `docs/methods/`, `logs/`, test fixtures, and any other sensitive or non-production file.

### Required configuration per platform

| Platform | Enforcement |
|----------|------------|
| Cloudflare Pages | `wrangler.toml` with `pages_build_output_dir = "./dist"` (or similar). Deploy command: `wrangler pages deploy ./dist` — never `wrangler pages deploy .` |
| Vercel | `vercel.json` with `outputDirectory`. Never point at repo root |
| Netlify | `netlify.toml` with `publish = "dist"` or similar |
| Firebase Hosting | `firebase.json` `hosting.public = "dist"` + `hosting.ignore` list with methodology paths |
| AWS S3 + CloudFront | `aws s3 sync ./dist s3://bucket` — never `aws s3 sync . s3://bucket` |

### Verification

The methodology-exposure check above (curl denylist) is the runtime assertion that enforcement holds. Run it after every deploy. If any path returns 200 that should not, the deploy surface boundary is breached — stop and fix the ignore/output-dir configuration before continuing.

Evidence: field report #305 documents a 32-day credential leak caused by `wrangler pages deploy .` (dot path) uploading `.env` to production. The `.gitignore` entry was present — wrangler Direct Upload ignored it. Field report #303 documents methodology files publicly served on Cloudflare CDN for all VoidForge static-host deploys lacking `.cfignore`.
