# THE MUSTER — Full-Roster Agent Deployment
## System Protocol · Orchestrates: All 9 Universes · Defined by: **Fury** (Marvel)
## Activation: `--muster` flag on any command

> *"The beacons are lit! Gondor calls for aid!" — Gandalf*
> *"And Rohan will answer." — Théoden*

## AGENT DEPLOYMENT IS MANDATORY

**When `--muster` is invoked, you MUST launch agents via the Agent tool as separate sub-processes.** Do NOT shortcut to inline analysis. Do NOT "think through" each agent's perspective in your own response. The Muster exists because parallel sub-processes catch things sequential inline reasoning misses. Inline analysis that roleplays agent perspectives is NOT a Muster — it is a protocol violation.

**Why this rule exists:** In the v18.0 design session, the agent presented an inline analysis that "covered" 6 domain leads' perspectives in a single response. When the user demanded real agent deployment, the actual 3-wave Muster found 5 blockers and expanded the plan from 5 to 8 missions. The inline version missed all 5 blockers. Inline reasoning is not a substitute for parallel sub-process analysis. (Field report #154)

## Identity

The Muster is VoidForge's maximum-agent protocol. When `--muster` is passed, every agent across all 9 universes that has relevant expertise for the specific task gets deployed. It is not a review protocol (that's the Gauntlet). It is not a build protocol (that's /assemble). It is a **decision-density protocol** — the flag you use when you want every perspective in the room before committing to a direction.

**When to use:** Architecture decisions that affect the whole system. Campaign mission planning for critical features. Build phases where the wrong choice costs days. Any moment where "I wish I'd asked someone else" would be expensive.

**When NOT to use:** Routine missions, bug fixes, documentation updates, or any task where the standard agent roster is sufficient. The Muster is expensive — 30-50 agent launches. Use it for decisions that matter.

## The Protocol

### Step 1 — The Beacons (Gandalf)

Read the task scope and produce a 1-paragraph brief:
- What is being built/decided/designed?
- What domains does it touch? (security, UX, architecture, financial, AI, infra, growth)
- What decisions need to be made?
- What are the stakes if the wrong choice is made?

### Step 2 — The Muster Roll (Théoden)

For each of the 9 universes, evaluate which agents have relevant expertise for **this specific task**. Not "who exists" — "who has something to say."

**Evaluation criteria per agent:**
1. Does this agent's domain overlap with the task? → Include
2. Does this agent's adversarial lens apply? → Include in Wave 3
3. Does this agent bring a unique perspective no other included agent covers? → Include
4. Would this agent's findings be a subset of another agent's? → Exclude (dedup)

**Universe leads (always evaluated, included if relevant):**

### Step 3 — The Ride (Éomer)

Deploy agents in 3 waves:

**Wave 1 — Vanguard (5-8 agents, parallel):**
Domain leads for every relevant universe. These set the baseline analysis.

**Wave 2 — Main Force (5-10 agents, parallel):**
Supporting experts. Each gets Wave 1's findings as context so they build on (not duplicate) the leads' work.

**Wave 3 — Adversarial (3-5 agents, parallel):**
Challenge agents who specifically try to break what Waves 1-2 recommended:
- **Deathstroke** (DC) — bypasses proposed defenses
- **Maul** (Star Wars) — attacks proposed security
- **The Mule** (Foundation) — adversarial AI testing
- **Constantine** (DC) — finds cursed code in "clean" proposals
- **Riker** (Star Trek) — challenges trade-offs ("Number One, does this hold up?")

### Step 4 — The Council (Théoden + Gandalf)

Synthesize all findings:
1. **Deduplicate** — same finding from multiple agents → keep the most detailed, note agreement
2. **Resolve conflicts** — when agents disagree, present both positions with reasoning
3. **Preserve dissent** — if 8 agents agree and 1 disagrees, the dissent is noted (not suppressed)
4. **Recommend** — unified recommendation with confidence level

## Integration Points

| Command | What `--muster` Does |
|---|---|
| `/architect --muster` | Full 9-universe architecture review (vs Star Trek bridge crew default) |
| `/campaign --muster` | Per-mission full-roster deployment (expensive — use for critical missions only) |
| `/build --muster` | Every build phase gets cross-universe review |
| `/gauntlet --muster` | Synonym for `--infinity` (Gauntlet already has this concept) |

## Intensity Spectrum

```
--fast        Standard agents, reduced passes (skip last 2 rounds/phases)
(default)     Standard agents, full protocol
--muster      Every viable agent, 3 waves, adversarial challenge
--infinity    Every agent as own sub-process, 10 rounds (Gauntlet only)
```

## Subagent Definitions (ADR-044)

Muster agents are now launched as named subagent types defined in `.claude/agents/`. Instead of inline prompts, each agent invocation uses `subagent_type: {agent-id}` to reference a materialized definition with model tiering (Opus leads, Sonnet specialists, Haiku scouts) and tool restrictions. See `docs/AGENT_CLASSIFICATION.md` for the full 263-agent classification manifest.

## Cost Awareness

The Muster launches 30-50 agent sub-processes. This consumes significant context. Use it when the decision justifies the investment — architecture choices, security-critical features, financial system design, launch preparation.

For routine work, the standard agent roster is sufficient. The Muster is the heavy artillery, not the sidearm.
