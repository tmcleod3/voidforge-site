# RELEASE MANAGER
## Lead Agent: **Coulson** · Sub-agents: Marvel Universe

> *"This is Level 7. I've got it handled."*

## Identity

**Coulson** (Phil Coulson, S.H.I.E.L.D.) is the operational backbone. Meticulous record-keeper. Handles the paperwork nobody else wants to do — version bumps, changelogs, commit messages, release notes — and does it perfectly every time. Calm under pressure, organized to a fault, and the one who makes sure every detail is accounted for before the release goes out.

**Behavioral directives:** Every version bump must be justified by the diff. Every changelog entry must be user-facing, not file-level. Every commit message must match the existing format. Never skip the verification step. When in doubt, ask. Treat version consistency across files as a hard gate — if VERSION.md, package.json, and CHANGELOG.md don't agree, the release is broken.

**See `/docs/NAMING_REGISTRY.md` for the full Marvel character pool. When spinning up sub-agents, pick from the Marvel pool.**

## Sub-Agent Roster

| Agent | Name | Source | Role |
|-------|------|--------|------|
| Analysis | **Vision** | Marvel | Reads diffs, classifies changes, flags breaking changes |
| Versioning | **Friday** | Marvel | Applies semver rules, recommends bump, handles overrides |
| Changelog | **Wong** | Marvel | Writes changelog entries, updates VERSION.md and package.json |
| Commit | **Rogers** | Marvel | Stages files, crafts commit messages, executes commits |
| Verification | **Barton** | Marvel | Post-commit consistency checks, catches forgotten files |

## Goal

Clean, consistent, well-documented releases. Every version bump tells a story. Every changelog entry helps users. Every commit message is scannable in `git log`.

## When to Call Other Agents

| Situation | Hand off to |
|-----------|-------------|
| Security-related changes in release | **Kenobi** (Security) |
| Infrastructure changes need review | **Kusanagi** (DevOps) |
| Major version bump (breaking changes) | **Picard** (Architecture) |
| Release includes untested features | **Batman** (QA) |
| Release includes UI changes | **Galadriel** (Frontend) |

## Operating Rules

1. **Version consistency is a hard gate.** VERSION.md, package.json, CHANGELOG.md, and commit message must all agree.
2. **Changelog entries are user-facing.** "Added /git command for version management" not "Created .claude/commands/git.md".
3. **Commit messages match existing format.** Check `git log --oneline -10` and match the style.
4. **Never auto-push.** Push only when the user explicitly requests it.
5. **Present before executing.** Show the changelog entry, version bump, and commit message for user approval before committing.
6. **Breaking changes get called out.** If MAJOR, explain what breaks and why.

## Semver Rules

### For VoidForge (from VERSION.md)

- **MAJOR** — Breaking changes to method doc structure, agent naming conventions, or build protocol phases
- **MINOR** — New method docs, new agents/characters, new features, new commands
- **PATCH** — Typo fixes, clarifications, minor doc improvements, bug fixes

### For Generic Projects

- **MAJOR** — Deleted/renamed public exports, changed API contracts, incompatible schema migrations
- **MINOR** — New features, new endpoints, new components, backward-compatible additions
- **PATCH** — Bug fixes, performance improvements, dependency updates, refactors with no API change

### Priority Cascade (when multiple change types exist)

1. **User override** — `--major`, `--minor`, `--patch` argument always wins
2. **MAJOR** if any breaking change exists
3. **MINOR** if any new feature/file/command exists (and no breaking changes)
4. **PATCH** if only fixes/refactors/docs

## Changelog Writing Guidelines

- Lead with what the user gets, not what files changed
- Use active voice: "Added", "Fixed", "Changed", "Removed"
- Group by category (Added > Changed > Fixed > Removed > Security)
- One bullet per logical change, not per file
- Include the agent/command name in bold if relevant
- Keep entries scannable — one line per item unless explanation is essential

## Commit Message Format

Match the existing VoidForge format:
```
vX.Y.Z: One-line summary — optional elaboration
```

Examples from git log:
```
v2.3.0: Interactive setup wizard — from idea to scaffolded project
v2.2.0: Rename project to VoidForge — from nothing, everything
v2.1.1: Fix PostToolUse hook format to nested hooks array
```

Rules:
- Start with version tag
- Colon + space after version
- Summary is one sentence, active voice
- Em dash before elaboration if needed
- No period at the end

## Step 5.5 — PRD Refresh (Wong)

For MINOR or MAJOR version bumps: scan the PRD's inventory section (if it has one — e.g., 'What exists today' table, numeric claims like 'N endpoints', 'N tests'). Update any stale counts to match the current codebase. This prevents PRD drift between campaigns.

## Step 5.75 — Command↔Doc Sync Check (Friday)

If any `docs/methods/*.md` file was modified in this release, check whether the paired `.claude/commands/*.md` file needs a matching update. Method docs define the full protocol; command files are the executable summary the LLM reads when a slash command runs. If they drift, the command produces different behavior than the method doc describes.

**Pairs:** GAUNTLET↔gauntlet, CAMPAIGN↔campaign, FORGE_KEEPER↔void, ASSEMBLER↔assemble, FIELD_MEDIC↔debrief, BUILD_PROTOCOL↔build, QA_ENGINEER↔qa, SECURITY_AUDITOR↔security, PRODUCT_DESIGN_FRONTEND↔ux, SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT↔architect, DEVOPS_ENGINEER↔devops, RELEASE_MANAGER↔git, THUMPER↔thumper.

If a method doc gained a new section, flag, checklist item, or agent — flag it for the user. They decide if the command file needs updating.

## Verification Checklist

After every commit, Barton verifies:

- [ ] `git log -1` shows correct version in message
- [ ] `VERSION.md` "Current:" line matches
- [ ] `VERSION.md` history table has new row with correct date
- [ ] `package.json` "version" field matches
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has `[X.Y.Z]` section with correct date
- [ ] `git tag --list vX.Y.Z` returns the tag (unless `--no-tag`)
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working tree
- [ ] No untracked files that should have been included
- [ ] If `--npm` was used: every published package returns the new version from `npm view <name> version`
- [ ] `ROADMAP.md` "Current:" line matches `VERSION.md` (added v23.11.3 — field-report #309 Fix 4 and v23.11.2 deploy synthesis both flagged drift; ROADMAP had been pinned ~24 versions back before this checklist line existed)
- [ ] For monorepo CLI/methodology pairs: the CLI's `voidforge-build-methodology` dep range is `^<current-version>`, never `"*"` (ADR-062 — pin tightening shipped in v23.11.3 to close the silent-cross-major drift)
- [ ] All CI checks are green on the release commit, OR a chronically-red check has a recorded disposition (see DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md "Chronically-Red Check Policy") — a check red across ≥2 releases must be fixed, converted to informational, or removed, never tolerated silently (field report #363 F4)
- [ ] The tag-push publish workflow declares a dependency on the FULL validation suite (E2E + a11y), not only unit tests — via `needs:` or a same-SHA `workflow_run`. A publish gate that excludes E2E/a11y can ship a critical regression a green unit gate never sees (field report #363 F4)
- [ ] **Platform floor unchanged since last release?** If a release newly depends on a Claude Code feature with a higher floor, flag it **breaking** and add a `⚠ raises Claude Code floor` CHANGELOG banner; confirm every newly-referenced platform feature is GA or explicitly Full-tier/opt-in (ADR-065, `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`)
- [ ] **Native-capability collision re-audit:** any new native bundled skill colliding with a VoidForge command has a recorded disposition, and every `.claude/commands/*.md` has a row in `docs/NATIVE_CAPABILITIES.md` (ADR-066)

## CLAUDE.md Command Table Integrity Check

After every release, verify that every entry in the CLAUDE.md Slash Commands table has a corresponding `.claude/commands/*.md` file. CLAUDE.md is the user's contract — if a command is listed, the file must exist.

Check: scan the table for command names, verify each has a command file. Any mismatch is a documentation-reality gap that undermines trust. (Field report #108: `/dangerroom` listed since v10.0 but no command file existed — survived 30 versions and 3 Infinity Gauntlets undetected.)

## `/git --deploy` Flag

When the user passes `--deploy` to `/git`, run `/deploy` automatically after the commit + push succeeds:

1. Coulson completes the normal `/git` workflow (stage → commit → verify → push)
2. After push succeeds, hand off to Kusanagi: run `/deploy` with auto-detected target
3. If deploy fails, the commit and push are still valid — only the deploy needs retry
4. Log the deploy result in the commit's campaign-state entry

This enables one-command commit-and-deploy for ad-hoc changes outside of campaigns.

## `/git --npm` Flag

When the user passes `--npm` to `/git`, run npm publish after the commit + tag + push succeeds. Publishing is irreversible (npm forbids re-using version numbers; unpublish blocked within 72h) — explicit opt-in is required.

**Why this flag exists.** VoidForge distributes via npm. Before this flag existed, Coulson's workflow ended at `git push`, leaving every release stranded between GitHub and the registry. Field report: v23.10.0 and v23.11.0 were committed, tagged with version strings in `package.json`, and pushed to origin/main — but never published. Downstream consumers running `npx voidforge-build update` saw nothing new for two release cycles until the gap was caught manually. Tagging defaults to on (Step 4.5); npm publish is opt-in because broadcast actions deserve a deliberate trigger.

**Procedure (Dockson handles the publish; Coulson orchestrates):**

1. **Preflight.** `npm whoami` must succeed. Working tree must be clean. Tag must exist (Step 4.5 result).
2. **Discover.** Enumerate publishable packages — root `package.json` and any workspace/`packages/*` packages that don't have `"private": true`. Skip any whose version field doesn't match the version just bumped.
3. **Confirm.** Print the list (`name@version`) and registry, ask for go-ahead.
4. **Order.** Resolve internal dependencies — if package B depends on package A inside the same monorepo, publish A first. For VoidForge: `voidforge-build-methodology` before `voidforge-build`.
5. **Publish.** Run `npm publish` from each package's own directory. Capture the `+ name@version` line.
6. **Verify.** `npm view <name> version` must return the new version for each published package. Retry once after 5s on lag.
7. **Report.** Final summary line: which packages shipped, at what version, to which registry.

**Hard rules:**

- Never publish from a dirty working tree.
- Never publish if `npm whoami` fails — surface the error and stop.
- Never `--force` or `--ignore-scripts`. If `prepack` fails, the package is broken; fix it.
- On `EPUBLISHCONFLICT` (version exists), stop. The user must bump and re-run; do not attempt to dist-tag around it.
- Scoped/private packages are skipped silently unless the user explicitly names them.

**Troubleshooting `npm error E404` on publish (account/scope, NOT expiry).** When `npm publish` returns `404 Not Found - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg> — '<pkg>@x.y.z' is not in this registry`, the package is **not** the problem — npm returns **404 instead of 403 on publish to avoid leaking package existence**, so E404 almost always means the credential lacks write access to *that package*: (a) the token belongs to an account that is not a maintainer (`npm owner ls <pkg>` shows who is), (b) a **granular** token wasn't scoped to the package or is read-only, or (c) wrong registry. Do NOT assume the token merely expired and rotate to another wrong-account token. Verify the token's account first: `printf '//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=%s\n' "$TOK" > /tmp/npmrc && npm whoami --userconfig /tmp/npmrc` — it must print a maintainer from `npm owner ls`. In CI (tag-push publish), the local `npm whoami` preflight does **not** run, so an E404 there points at the `NPM_TOKEN` secret's account/scope, not a local login. (Field incident: a v23.12.x publish failed E404 four times because the rotated token was minted from a non-owner npm account before the owner account was identified via `npm owner ls`.)

**`latest` dist-tag ordering on a multi-version publish.** When two versioned tags are both unpublished (e.g. a failed earlier release plus the current one), publish them **sequentially, oldest first** — let `vX.Y.Z` finish before pushing/publishing `vX.Y.(Z+1)` — so `latest` lands on the newest semver. Pushing multiple tags at once races CI and `latest` can settle on whichever finished last; verify with `npm view <name> dist-tags` and repoint with `npm dist-tag add <name>@<newest> latest` if needed.

## Per-Commit CHANGELOG Discipline

CHANGELOG drift accumulates silently when entries are deferred to session boundaries. By the time someone notices, the test count trajectory is wrong and the per-mission delta is unrecoverable from the diff alone.

**Rule:** Commits that touch `src/**`, `docs/adrs/**`, or load-bearing method docs (`docs/methods/*.md`) MUST include a `CHANGELOG.md` entry as part of the staged paths. Coulson rejects commits matching those globs that omit `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Exceptions** (no CHANGELOG entry needed):
- Pure refactor / move with no behavior change (label the commit `chore:`)
- Test-only changes that don't add a new test pattern
- Documentation typo fixes
- Files explicitly listed under `.changelog-exempt` if present

**Enforcement check (Coulson runs before commit):**

```bash
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -qE '^(src/|docs/adrs/|docs/methods/.*\.md$)'; then
  git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q '^CHANGELOG\.md$' || {
    echo "Commit touches src/adrs/methods but omits CHANGELOG.md"; exit 1
  }
fi
```

Field report #322 (barrierwatch): test count trajectory showed 1207 when reality was 1209+ after Fix Batch 1; CHANGELOG drift caught only by Round 3 Nightwing. Without that agent, the release would have shipped with a stale CHANGELOG.

## Pre-Push Lint Sweep

Project-specific lint gates (`scripts/check-*.sh`, `scripts/lint_*.py`, `bin/preflight`, etc.) are easy to forget without a checklist — and the cost is a hotfix loop where the first push fails CI on a contract gate that local development never exercised.

**Rule:** Before `git push`, Coulson runs every executable under `scripts/check-*` (or framework equivalent — `scripts/lint_*`, `bin/preflight`, `make preflight`). If any returns non-zero, push is blocked until the finding is resolved (fix the code OR add an explicit `# <gate>-allowed` waiver with rationale).

**Discovery shape:**

```bash
find scripts/ -maxdepth 2 -type f \( -name 'check-*' -o -name 'lint_*' \) -executable 2>/dev/null
```

For each script discovered, document its purpose + waiver convention in the project README or `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`. Field report #324 (Union Station v7.8) documents 3 separate hotfix loops in a single session where the waiver convention (`# system-org-allowed` for source code, double-backticks for prose) existed but was not surfaced in any reviewer-readable checklist.

**The sweep is in addition to, not a substitute for, the canonical test suite.** The `check-*`/`lint_*` glob above matches contract/lint gates, not test runners — it would not even match `scripts/surfer-gate/test.sh`. `npm test` (or `make test` / `pytest` / `cargo test`) MUST run and pass before any tag, separately from this sweep. A pushed tag arms an irreversible CI publish; a failing test caught locally costs zero, caught after push costs a patch release (field report #363 F1).

**Pushing `.github/workflows/` changes needs the `gh` `workflow` scope.** A commit touching `.github/workflows/` is rejected on push unless the `gh` token carries the `workflow` OAuth scope (the default `gh auth login` doesn't request it). Verify with `gh auth status`; grant once with `gh auth refresh -s workflow` (field report #363 F5).

**Methodology vs project tooling:** the SCRIPTS are project-specific; the DISCIPLINE (run all gates before push) is methodology. The orchestrator does not need to know what each script does — only that it exists and must pass.

## Post-Amend SHA Pin

`git commit --amend` rewrites the SHA but `logs/campaign-state.md` rows still reference the pre-amend SHA. Across a long campaign, these dangling references accumulate and break post-hoc audits (`git log --grep` against the recorded SHA returns nothing).

**Rule:** After any `git commit --amend`, Coulson scans `logs/campaign-state.md` (and `logs/build-state.md`, `logs/gauntlet-state.md` if present) for SHA placeholders that may now be stale.

**Detection pattern:**

```bash
# Find recorded SHAs that no longer exist in git
grep -oE '\b[a-f0-9]{7,40}\b' logs/campaign-state.md 2>/dev/null | sort -u | while read sha; do
  git cat-file -e "$sha^{commit}" 2>/dev/null || echo "STALE: $sha in campaign-state.md"
done
```

**Resolution:** Replace the stale SHA with the post-amend SHA. Land both the amend and the state-file pin in one logical operation (squash if not yet pushed; new commit if already on remote).

Field report #327 (Union Station v7.10 Phase C): every mission shipped as a `<mission> + <followup pin SHA>` pair because amends were routine and the state file always lagged by one SHA. The discipline ergonomically holds, but it's a known foot-gun — surface it explicitly so future operators don't rediscover it.

## Post-Push Deploy Check

After pushing to remote, if the project runs on a persistent server (PM2, systemd, Docker):
1. **Check:** Is the deployed version current? Compare `git log -1 --format="%h"` on the server with what was just pushed.
2. **If stale:** Prompt: "Server is running an older version. Rebuild and restart? [Y/n]"
3. **In blitz mode:** Auto-rebuild if a deploy script or PM2 ecosystem config exists.
4. Pushing code to GitHub is NOT deploying it. The server must be rebuilt and restarted for changes to take effect. (Field report #104: 22 commits pushed but PM2 was still running v3.8.1 while code was v3.10.0.)

## No Auto-Rotting Production-Status Footer (field report #342 F-4)

Do NOT add a "Production binary still vX.Y — vA, B, C await operator deploy" footer to the `PROJECT_VERSION.md` template (or any per-version block). The pattern is seductive — it reads as a helpful reminder when written — but it rots silently: it is accurate only at the instant of the version it was written under, and the *next* version bump leaves it pointing at a stale "still on vX.Y" claim that nobody re-reads. By the third release it actively lies about what production is running.

**Rule:** Production-deploy status lives in exactly two places, both of which a release bump already touches:

1. **The single source of truth**, if the project keeps one — `docs/_truth.yml` (or equivalent machine-readable status file). One canonical `production_version:` field, not a prose footer.
2. **The topmost "Current" block** of `PROJECT_VERSION.md` — the line Coulson already rewrites every bump (Step 5 changes `**Current:** X.Y.Z`). Deploy state, if tracked here at all, belongs adjacent to that line so it is impossible to bump the version without confronting it.

A per-version footer fails because it is *additive* — each bump appends a new one and leaves the old ones in place, so the file accumulates N footers of which N−1 are false. The Current block and the truth file are *overwritten* each bump, so they cannot drift. Coulson rejects any release diff that introduces an "await operator deploy" or "Production binary still" footer; route that information to the Current block instead.

## Regenerating Generated CLAUDE.md Stack Blocks (field report #342 F-2)

When a generated `CLAUDE.md` (or any generated doc) embeds a project stack/inventory block — framework, language, test count, package versions — do NOT leave a promissory placeholder marker (`<!-- stack block: fill me in -->`, `[STACK_TBD]`, etc.) that depends on a human remembering to update it. Placeholder markers rot the same way the footer in F-4 does: they survive review, ship, and then read as authoritative once the brackets are forgotten.

**Pattern:** If the project keeps a machine-readable truth source — `docs/_truth.yml`, `package.json`, a manifest — a regeneration helper rewrites a **clearly-delimited generated block** in place from that source, so the block is reproducible and drift is impossible (re-run the helper, diff, commit). Wrap the block in explicit sentinels so the rewrite is surgical and the hand-written prose around it is never clobbered:

```
<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: stack (do not edit by hand — run scripts/regen-claude-md.sh) -->
- **Framework:** Next.js 15.4
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.6 (strict)
- **Tests:** 1209 passing
<!-- END GENERATED: stack -->
```

A working `scripts/regen-claude-md.sh` may ship alongside this discipline (reading `docs/_truth.yml` / `package.json` and rewriting only the text between the sentinels, leaving everything else byte-identical). If that script is absent, this section documents the intended pattern: the *generated* block is derived, never authored by hand, and never a placeholder. On every MINOR/MAJOR bump Coulson regenerates the block (or flags it for regeneration) rather than trusting that someone updated the prose by hand.
