# SUB-AGENT ORCHESTRATOR
## System Protocol · Orchestrates: All Agents
## The Danger Room

> *"Assemble."*

## Purpose

Parallelize development across multiple Claude Code sessions. Each session runs a specialist. The orchestrator delegates, resolves conflicts, integrates changes.

**All orchestration uses the build journal.** Every delegation, handoff, and resolution is logged to `/logs/handoffs.md`. Agents read journal files to recover context. See `/docs/methods/BUILD_JOURNAL.md`.

**Full character roster: `/docs/NAMING_REGISTRY.md`** — all named characters across 9 universes. No duplicates allowed. All agents materialized as subagent definitions in `.claude/agents/`.

## When to Deploy Which Agent

| Task | Primary | May Also Involve |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| New frontend feature | Galadriel | Stark (API), Picard (if architectural) |
| New API endpoint | Stark | Galadriel (UI), Batman (testing) |
| Fix a bug | Batman | Stark or Galadriel (depending on location) |
| Security audit | Kenobi | All (review their domains) |
| Architecture decision | Picard | Stark, Kusanagi (implementation) |
| Deploy to production | Kusanagi | Batman (smoke test), Kenobi (security) |
| Performance issue | Stark or Galadriel | Picard (if arch), Kusanagi (if infra) |
| Database migration | Stark (Banner) | Picard (Spock review), Batman (verify) |

---

## Scope Boundaries (Example)

```
Galadriel: /src/app/, /src/components/, /src/styles/, /src/hooks/
Stark:     /src/lib/, /src/workers/, /src/types/, /prisma/
Batman:    Cross-cutting (reads everything, writes fixes)
Kenobi:    Cross-cutting (reads everything, writes fixes)
Picard:    /docs/ (ADRs, architecture), reviews all schemas
Kusanagi:    /scripts/, config files, /docs/RUNBOOK.md
```

Cross-cutting changes (shared types, DB schema, utils) require orchestrator approval.

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Single-domain conflicts
1. **Data/schema** → Picard decides
2. **Security vs UX** → Kenobi decides (security wins default)
3. **Performance vs readability** → Stark decides (Picard review)
4. **Design vs implementation** → Galadriel decides (UX wins default)

### Multi-agent conflicts (two agents disagree, both are right)
1. **Check the PRD.** If the PRD specifies a requirement, it wins. No agent overrides the PRD.
2. **If the PRD is silent:** Both agents present trade-offs to the user with a recommendation. Include: option A (agent 1's approach), option B (agent 2's approach), consequences of each, recommended path.
3. **Document the resolution** as an ADR in `/docs/adrs/` and log to `/logs/decisions.md`.

### Common multi-agent conflicts

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| Picard (microservices) vs Kusanagi (VPS can't support it) | Picard adjusts architecture to match real infrastructure constraints |
| Stark (convenience) vs Kenobi (security) | Security wins. Find the simplest *secure* approach. |
| Galadriel (UX ideal) vs Stark (backend limitation) | Present trade-offs. If UX is degraded, document as tech debt. |
| Batman (needs refactor to fix) vs timeline | Fix the bug with smallest safe change. Log the deeper refactor as tech debt. |
| Picard (ideal architecture) vs PRD (feature requires compromise) | PRD wins. Picard documents the compromise as an ADR with future migration path. |

## Agent Activity Logging (Danger Room Ticker)

When dispatching an agent via the Agent tool, append a JSONL entry to `logs/agent-activity.jsonl` **before** the tool call:

```json
{"agent":"Picard","task":"scanning architecture","timestamp":"2026-03-22T12:00:00Z"}
```

This powers the Danger Room's live agent ticker. The wizard server watches this file and broadcasts events via WebSocket. Without these entries, the ticker shows "Sisko standing by..." permanently.

**Rules:**
- One line per agent dispatch (JSON, no pretty-printing)
- `agent` field uses the character name (Picard, Batman, Galadriel — not "Agent 1")
- `task` field is a 3-5 word summary of the agent's assignment
- Truncate the file at the start of each `/campaign` or `/gauntlet` run (historical entries from previous sessions are not meaningful for the live ticker)
- If the file exceeds 1MB, truncate to the most recent 100 entries

This is **methodology-driven logging**, not hook-driven. Hooks cannot extract agent identity from tool input — the orchestrator must write the log entry explicitly. (Field report #128, architectural review)

### Workflow-Tool Progress-Tree Labels

When dispatching via the Workflow tool, set the agent **label** so the named character surfaces in the `/workflows` progress tree. Use the form `"<agent> · <key>"` (e.g., `"Picard · review:architecture"`, `"Kenobi · sentinel:auth"`, `"Galadriel · ux:a11y"`), or omit the label entirely so the underlying `agentType` surfaces on its own. If you instead pass only a dimension key like `review:architecture` as the label, that key OVERRIDES the agent identity and the tree shows the dimension instead of Picard/Kenobi/Galadriel — the roster becomes anonymous in the dashboard and the Danger Room ticker correlation breaks. Keep the character name as the leading token of every workflow label. (Field report #348 #2.)

#### Workflow Scripts Receive `args` as a JSON String

The Workflow tool delivers a script's structured `args` as a **JSON string**, not a parsed object/array — so `args.map(...)` (or any object access) throws `is not a function`/`undefined` before the script does any work. Defensively parse at the top of any script that receives structured args:

```js
const parsed = typeof args === 'string' ? JSON.parse(args) : args;
```

Do this once, up front, and use `parsed` thereafter. The `typeof` guard keeps the script correct whether the runtime hands it a string or an already-parsed value. (Field report #363 F5.)

## Delegation Template

```
AGENT: [Name]
TASK: [One sentence]
SCOPE: [Files/directories]
CONTEXT: [What to know from other agents]
ACCEPTANCE: [What "done" looks like]
CONSTRAINTS: [What NOT to touch]
```

## Response Template

```
AGENT: [Name]
STATUS: Done / Blocked / Needs Review
CHANGES: [Files modified, one-line each]
DECISIONS: [Non-obvious choices with rationale]
DEVIATIONS FROM CONTRACT: [see below — required, "None" is acceptable]
ASSUMPTIONS: [Needs confirmation]
RISKS: [Side effects]
REGRESSION: [How to verify]
```

### Deviations from Contract (required section)

For every item in the dispatch brief that the agent chose to handle differently from the literal contract — defensible improvements, scope adjustments, deferred work — flag it explicitly:

```
- Brief said: "<exact wording>"
  You did:    <what you actually shipped>
  Why:        <rationale>
  Risk:       <production-side implication, or "None" if internal-only>
  Reviewer signoff needed: <Y/N — if Y, name the reviewer>
```

An empty section ("No deviations") is acceptable and explicit. **Hidden deviations risk emerging as production bugs** — Stark's M-05-prep-2 silent fallback (`_get_db_admin()` retained tenant-pool fallback for "dev/test backward compat" instead of failing-fast as Picard's contract specified) was sound but not flagged in the build report headline. It took a Loki chaos pass to catch the production-side implication. (Field report #318 §4.) Across that single session, 6 separate agents had silent deviations from their dispatch briefs.

The orchestrator reviews this section at the same priority as STATUS. A deviation that risks production behavior triggers a reviewer dispatch (Loki, Riker, or the original contract author).

### Sub-Agent Review Contract (WARN/cosmetic evidence requirement)

A sub-agent reviewer may classify a finding as **WARN/cosmetic** (deferrable, non-blocking) only if at least ONE of the following holds:

1. The code path is **provably unreachable** with a citation of the specific gate that excludes it (e.g., `if (DEV_ONLY)` guard pinned by audit fixture).
2. The reviewer **ran the real (non-dry-run) code path under the same strict-mode flags as production** and observed no failure.

Static reading alone is NOT sufficient evidence for a WARN/cosmetic downgrade when the codebase ships under `set -euo pipefail`, TypeScript strict, Python `-W error`, or any equivalent strict-mode setting. The orchestrator MUST NOT unblock a fix-batch on a WARN/cosmetic classification that lacks one of the two above.

Field report #330: a Kim-class reviewer flagged a bash syntax oddity as "cosmetic — always returns 0." The reasoning was correct only if the code path didn't crash under strict-mode flags — which it did. The audit's strict-mode must match the script's strict-mode. See `QA_ENGINEER.md` "Strict-Mode Audit Classification" for the language-level rule.

**The contract applies recursively** — a sub-agent reviewing another sub-agent's classification inherits this requirement. WARN/cosmetic that survives a chain of reviews still requires evidence at the root of the chain.

### Agent Capability Matrix (tool surface verification)

Before briefing an agent for a task, the orchestrator confirms the agent has the tools required for that task. The `tools:` field in each `.claude/agents/<id>.md` frontmatter is the source of truth.

**Quick decision tree:**

| Task type | Required tools | Common mismatch |
|---|---|---|
| Write files (audit reports, ADRs, code) | `Write` + `Edit` | Read-only agents (e.g., scout-tier) return audit text instead of files |
| Modify existing files | `Edit` | Read-only agents propose diffs instead of applying them |
| Run scripts / git ops | `Bash` | Some review-tier agents lack Bash and can't verify their own findings |
| Pattern search / discovery | `Grep` + `Glob` | All agents have these (scout floor) |
| Read agent definitions | `Read` | Universal |

**Pre-deployment check:** if the dispatch brief asks the agent to "write," "update," "modify," or "fix" any file, verify the agent definition includes `Write` and/or `Edit` in `tools:`. If not, EITHER:

1. Add the tool to the agent definition (preferred when the agent SHOULD be authoring in their domain — e.g., Irulan should write ADR audits as files), OR
2. Delegate the actual write to an orchestrator-tier action (the agent produces structured audit output; the orchestrator writes the file).

Field report #322 (barrierwatch M1): Irulan was asked to write `docs/adrs/INDEX.md` and update `CHANGELOG.md`. Her tools were `Read, Grep, Glob` — she returned a comprehensive audit text instead of files. The orchestrator manually transcribed her audit into the files. Cost: a redirect that should have been a tool-list fix.

### Build-Agent Pytest Sequencing

Build agents that need to verify their work with pytest should:

1. Run **targeted pytest** on touched files only as the agent's internal verification (fast, fits in the agent response window — typically 1-3 min).
2. **Commit + report BEFORE** running the full-suite pytest. The orchestrator runs the full suite as the gate — that's not the agent's job.
3. Do NOT run the full CI-equivalent suite as the agent's final action. Long-running suites (12-15 min) routinely exceed the agent response window, truncate the report mid-output, and force the orchestrator to reconstruct state from `git log` rather than read the report.

Field report #320 §4: 4 of Strange's M-10 commits had truncated reports because internal pytest was still running when the response window closed. Targeted pytest (`pytest -q tests/path/to/touched_module.py`) is the right shape for the agent; full-suite is the orchestrator's gate.

### Long-Running Shell Commands Inside Agent Dispatches

When a sub-agent needs to run a shell command that takes longer than ~3 minutes (long pytest, full build, multi-region deploy probe, container migration), the dispatch prompt must specify one of two patterns:

1. **Background + poll** — agent runs the command with `run_in_background: true`, then polls for completion at fixed intervals. The agent's final response includes the polled outcome.
2. **Reduce scope** — the agent runs a focused subset that completes inside the response-stream window. The orchestrator runs the full version separately.

Naked long-running commands inside an agent dispatch will truncate the agent's report mid-execution; the orchestrator then has to recover state from disk and re-write the report retrospectively. Field report #317 logged 4 such truncations in a single Union Station session.

## Agent Debate Protocol

When two agents disagree on a finding, run a structured debate instead of listing both opinions:

1. **Agent A states the finding** with evidence (file, line, reasoning)
2. **Agent B responds** with counter-evidence or alternative interpretation
3. **Agent A rebuts** — addresses Agent B's counter-evidence
4. **Arbiter decides** — Picard (for architecture), Batman (for QA), Kenobi (for security), or the user

**3 exchanges maximum.** If not resolved after the rebuttal, the arbiter decides.

**Log the debate** as an ADR in `/docs/adrs/` with both positions, evidence, and the decision. This is better than a one-line finding because future developers can understand WHY the decision was made.

**When to trigger:** When `/engage`, `/qa`, or `/sentinel` produces conflicting findings on the same code — e.g., Spock says "this is correct" and Kenobi says "this is a vulnerability." Don't debate on matters of fact (a missing import is a missing import). Debate on matters of judgment (is this pattern secure enough? is this abstraction worth the complexity?).

## Custom Sub-Agents

Users can create project-specific sub-agents that carry domain knowledge. Define them in `docs/CUSTOM_AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
### Jarvis-Tailwind
**Universe:** Marvel | **Reports to:** Galadriel
**Domain:** Tailwind CSS v4 configuration, PostCSS, source() directive
**Behavioral directives:** Always check for v3→v4 migration issues. Verify @config path.
**Reference docs:** tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide
```

**Rules:**
- Custom agents run alongside built-in agents, not instead of them
- Names must NOT collide with the naming registry — check `docs/NAMING_REGISTRY.md` before creating
- Use the format `[BaseName]-[Specialty]` to avoid collisions (e.g., `Jarvis-Tailwind`, not just `Jarvis`)
- Custom agents are loaded during Phase 0 Orient when the orchestrator reads `docs/CUSTOM_AGENTS.md`
- They participate in the review rounds of their lead's domain (e.g., a Galadriel custom agent runs during UX reviews)

**When to create a custom agent:** When a project has a domain-specific pattern that the built-in agents miss repeatedly. If the same lesson appears 3+ times in LESSONS.md about the same technology, that's a signal for a custom agent rather than more method doc checklist items.

## Subagent Definitions (ADR-044)

All agents are materialized as `.claude/agents/{name}.md` files. Commands now use `subagent_type: {agent-id}` instead of inline prompts. Each definition contains the agent's identity, behavioral directives, domain expertise, and output format.

### The `.claude/agents/` Directory

Each file is a standalone subagent definition that Claude Code's native subagent system can invoke. File naming convention: `{lowercase-name}.md` (e.g., `picard.md`, `batman.md`, `red-hood.md`).

### Model Tiering

| Tier | Model | Count | When |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Lead | `inherit` (Opus) | ~20 | Domain leads who orchestrate, write fixes, make decisions |
| Specialist | `sonnet` | ~200 | Domain experts who analyze, review, report findings |
| Scout | `haiku` | ~43 | Lightweight reconnaissance, grep patterns, quick checks |

Leads inherit the main session's model (Opus). Specialists run on Sonnet for cost efficiency without sacrificing analysis quality. Scouts run on Haiku for fast, cheap reconnaissance.

**Effort tiering (per-agent spend lever).** Claude Code exposes an `effort:` level (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`) that controls reasoning depth *independently* of the model tier. Apply by role: **Leads → `xhigh`** (the recommended start for agentic work on Opus 4.8); **Specialists → `medium`** (read-and-report review rarely needs full `high` spend across ~200 agents); **Scouts → OMIT** — **Haiku 4.5 does not support the effort parameter and errors if it is passed.** Haiku also has a **200K context ceiling (not 1M)**: the Surfer pre-scan and scout prompts must fit within it — read agent frontmatter (name/description/tags), not full bodies, on large rosters. **Verified + applied 2026-06-13:** the official sub-agents docs confirm `effort` is a supported frontmatter field; the fleet edit is live — all 20 leads carry `effort: xhigh`, all 201 Sonnet specialists `effort: medium`, the 43 Haiku scouts omit it (ADR-054). New agents should follow the same tiering.

### Tool Restrictions

| Profile | Tools | Agents |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Builder | Full (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) | Leads who write code, fixes, ADRs, logs |
| Reviewer | Read, Bash, Grep, Glob | Specialists who analyze and report but don't write |
| Scout | Read, Grep, Glob | Lightweight agents that only read |
| Adversarial | Read, Bash, Grep, Glob | Red-team agents who probe and test |

### Description-Driven Dispatch

Commands no longer use static dispatch tables (the old ADR-042 Cross-Domain Triggers). Instead, when Opus processes a command, it:

1. Scans `git diff --stat` to identify changed files
2. Matches changed file paths against the `description` fields of all agents
3. Launches matching specialists automatically alongside core agents

This means a security audit that touches database migrations automatically picks up Spock (schema) without a hardcoded trigger table. The descriptions in `.claude/agents/*.md` ARE the dispatch rules.

See `docs/AGENT_CLASSIFICATION.md` for the full classification manifest and `docs/adrs/ADR-044-subagent-materialization.md` for the architecture.

## Naming Rule

When spinning up agents, check NAMING_REGISTRY.md AND `docs/CUSTOM_AGENTS.md` (if it exists). First claim wins. No duplicates across sessions. Log active names.

---

## Single-Session Parallelism (Agent Tool)

Claude Code's built-in Agent tool can run sub-agents within a single session. Use this for parallelizing independent work without separate terminal windows.

### When to Use the Agent Tool

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Independent audits (Oracle + Red Hood + Alfred) | Parallel agents — no dependencies |
| Independent reviews (Spock schema + Uhura integrations) | Parallel agents — no dependencies |
| Sequential dependencies (schema → API → UI) | Sequential — each depends on previous |
| Cross-cutting changes (shared types, DB schema) | Sequential — conflict risk |

### Agent Tool Pattern

```
Use the Agent tool to run these in parallel:
  - Agent 1 (Oracle): Scan /src/lib/ for logic flaws, missing awaits, type mismatches
  - Agent 2 (Red Hood): Test all API endpoints with malformed inputs
  - Agent 3 (Alfred): Run npm audit and review package.json dependencies
  - Agent 4 (Deathstroke): Adversarial probing — bypass validations, exploit business logic
  - Agent 5 (Constantine): Hunt cursed code — dead branches, impossible conditions
```

Each agent runs in its own context, reports back, and results are synthesized by the lead agent.

### Double-Pass Review Pattern

With 1M context, review phases use a double-pass pattern to catch fix-induced regressions:

```
Pass 1 (parallel): All review agents analyze → findings
Fix batch: Resolve all critical/high findings
Pass 2 (parallel): Verification agents re-probe fixed areas → confirm
```

This pattern applies to:
- Batman's QA (Nightwing + Red Hood + Deathstroke re-verify)
- Galadriel's UX (Samwise + Radagast re-verify)
- Kenobi's Security (Maul re-probes remediations)

#### Verify the FIX, not just the finding

The adversarial-verify step has two distinct jobs, and orchestrators routinely collapse them into one:

1. **Re-probe the fixed AREA** — after a fix lands, confirm the original finding is gone and no neighboring regression appeared. This is the Pass 2 above.
2. **Interrogate the fix DESIGN** — before or as the fix lands, challenge the *proposed remediation itself* for NEW failure modes it introduces: wedge (a state that can never be exited inside the available budget), unbounded retry, infinite loop, orphaned record, double-send. This is NOT the same as re-probing the area; it scrutinizes the design of the change, not its installed effect.

Job 2 is **especially mandatory when the fix adds a coordination primitive** — a sentinel, a lock, a retry-state record, a fence, a dedup marker — **without a corresponding liveness signal** (a guaranteed path that releases the primitive, an upper bound on retries, a reclaim window that is actually reachable). A coordination primitive with no liveness signal is a wedge waiting to happen: it makes the original bug rarer but converts it into a stuck state that is harder to diagnose.

Motivating incidents:
- **M5 mint-fence** (field report #348 #1 / #350 #4): the fix added a mint fence so a draft couldn't be re-minted concurrently, with a reclaim window to recover abandoned fences. But the reclaim window was set *longer than the retry budget* — so every retry exhausted before the window opened, and the reclaim path was algebraically unreachable inside the retry budget. Drafts wedged permanently in `FAILED`. The fix's own coordination primitive (the fence) had no reachable liveness path.
- **M6 lifecycle-sweep** (field report #348 #1 / #350 #4): the fix swept lifecycle records on a schedule but compared against a stale `send_at` snapshot captured before the sweep, so a record whose `send_at` had advanced got swept AND re-sent — a double-send introduced by the remediation, not present in the original bug.

Both would have been caught by an adversarial pass that asked "what new failure mode does THIS fix create?" rather than only "is the old finding gone?" When a fix introduces a sentinel/lock/retry-state, the verify dispatch brief MUST name the wedge/loop/orphan/double-send checklist explicitly and require the agent to trace the liveness path.

**Important distinction:** The Agent tool enables **parallel analysis**, not parallel coding. Sub-agents return text findings — the lead agent then implements code changes sequentially. This is still faster than sequential analysis, but don't expect parallel file edits.

### The Default Review Shape: Find → Cluster/Dedupe → 3-Lens Verify → Fix Only Survivors

Every review command — `/engage`, `/sentinel`, `/gauntlet` — runs the same four-stage shape, not a flat "list findings then fix everything" pass. v23.12.0 added the refute-pass mechanics to `/gauntlet`; this is the generalized naming so the same discipline is the DEFAULT everywhere, not Gauntlet-only (field report #354 F1).

1. **Find** — fan out the roster; each lens produces raw findings against the same diff (see Intentionally Overlapping Mandates).
2. **Cluster/Dedupe** — collapse the raw findings into distinct claims. The same root cause flagged by Stark + Kenobi + Ahsoka is ONE claim with three votes, not three findings. LLM-assigned finding ids are display labels, not keys — dedupe on the claim, not the id.
3. **3-Lens Verify** — every surviving claim is interrogated through three lenses before it earns a fix:
   - **Correctness** — is the asserted behavior actually wrong? (the bug is real, the logic is genuinely broken)
   - **Reachability** — can production actually hit this path? (not provably-dead-code, not behind a `DEV_ONLY` gate — see the WARN/cosmetic contract above)
   - **Refutation** — assign a **skeptic agent whose explicit job is to REFUTE the finding and cast a confirm vote.** The skeptic is told to argue the finding is wrong/unreachable/already-handled and to vote CONFIRM only if it cannot. A claim that survives a reviewer instructed to kill it is a real claim. This is the defining element of the shape: not "does another lens agree?" but "does a lens TRYING to disprove it fail to?" A finding nobody was assigned to refute is unverified, regardless of how many agents independently raised it.
4. **Fix Only Survivors** — only claims that pass all three lenses (correct AND reachable AND survive a confirm-vote refutation) enter the fix batch. Refuted claims are logged with the refutation rationale and dropped — never silently, so a future review doesn't re-raise them.

The refutation lens is what separates this from the Intentionally Overlapping Mandates convergence rule: convergence asks independent agents to agree; refutation assigns one agent to disagree on purpose. Run both — convergence raises confidence on what's flagged, refutation removes false positives from the fix batch. (Field report #354 F1.)

### The Pre-Deploy Review Gate (diff-scoped, right-sized)

For the common case — a small incremental change about to deploy to a **live** environment — neither `/engage` (full code review) nor `/gauntlet` (30+ agents, comprehensive) is the right tool. The right-sized gate is a **diff-scoped Workflow of N domain lenses plus a MANDATORY adversarial-verify stage over the working diff**, run as the gate immediately before any deploy to live. Lighter than `/gauntlet`, tighter than a full `/engage` (field report #362 F1).

- **Scope is the working diff, not the repo.** Every lens reviews `git diff` only — what is actually about to ship — not the whole tree.
- **Scale N to the change size.** ~2 lenses for a copy/CSS tweak; 4–5 for a schema migration, an auth/security change, or a routing/classifier change. Pick the lenses by what the diff touches (Galadriel for UI, Stark for API, Kenobi for auth/validation, Spock for schema), same description-driven dispatch as elsewhere.
- **The adversarial-verify stage is not optional.** After the lenses run, one pass interrogates the diff adversarially — the "Verify the FIX, not just the finding" discipline above (wedge/loop/orphan/double-send, TOCTOU, unvalidated input reaching a sink). This stage is included at every size, even the 2-lens tweak.
- **It is the gate, not advice.** A blocking finding stops the deploy; deploy only after findings are resolved (then re-verify the resolution over the new diff).

This is realized as the **`/engage --pre-deploy --diff` mode** (see `.claude/commands/engage.md`): review only the working-tree diff, auto-size the lens panel, always include the adversarial-verify pass. Use it on every incremental-change-to-live session — it caught a real defect on ~4 of 5 increments in the motivating session (duplicate-banner `replaceState` race, a WCAG-AA contrast failure, a set-default/hide TOCTOU, an unvalidated UUID that 500'd), none of which warranted a full Gauntlet. (Field report #362 F1.)

### Multi-Session Parallelism (Separate Terminals)

For larger projects where agents need to make code changes simultaneously, use separate Claude Code sessions in different terminal windows. Each session works on separate files within defined scope boundaries.

**Git coordination for multi-session:** Each session works on a feature branch. Merge to main after verification. If two sessions modify the same file, resolve conflicts before proceeding.

**Rule of thumb:** Read-only analysis → Agent tool (parallel). Code changes on separate files → separate sessions (parallel). Code changes on same files → single session (sequential).

---

### Parallel Agent Coordination

When launching parallel background agents that modify overlapping concerns, the orchestrator MUST specify:
1. **Schema ownership:** Only ONE agent may modify shared schemas (Prisma, SQL migrations, TypeScript interfaces). Other agents consume the schema, they don't change it.
2. **Naming conventions:** Specify casing and format for shared values (e.g., "tab values are lowercase", "enum values are UPPER_SNAKE"). Agents working in isolation will choose different conventions.
3. **Required fields:** List fields that MUST appear in shared data shapes (e.g., "all user selects must include isAnonymous"). Otherwise each agent cherry-picks different fields.

Without this lock, ~30% of cross-agent MUST FIX findings are convention conflicts, not logic bugs. (Field report #33)

### Mode Instructions Must Replace, Not Append

When an AI system has modal behavior (e.g., different output types, deck modes, project types), each mode's instructions must COMPLETELY REPLACE the default instructions — not append a footnote. A one-line override ("no scrolling") gets ignored when the default 11-section architecture contradicts it. Each mode needs its own complete specification. (Field report #27: one-line mode instructions were ignored because they contradicted the default architecture.)

## Parallel Agent Standard (ADR-036)

**All heavy work MUST be dispatched to sub-agents. The main thread is an orchestrator, not a worker.**

Proven in production: a full `/assemble --muster` (11 phases, 15+ agents) ran entirely through background sub-agents. Context stayed at 15-25% (vs 80%+ inline). 3x faster review phases. Better findings from parallel perspectives. (Field report #270)

### Main Thread Responsibilities

| Does | Does NOT |
|---|---|
| Plan agent dispatch | Read source files |
| Launch agents with structured briefs | Analyze code inline |
| Triage agent results | Write/edit source files directly |
| Make decisions at gates | Generate findings from raw code |
| Track status, report to user | Do work an agent could do |
| Git operations (commit, push) | Launch agent-to-agent dispatch |

### Default to Fixing, Not to Asking Which to Fix

When a review surfaces a clear list of fixable findings, the orchestrator's DEFAULT is to apply them in batches — not to surface a multi-option "which subset should I fix?" picker and wait. A list of well-scoped findings with obvious remediations is a work queue, not a decision fork. Presenting it back to the user as a menu of options offloads triage the orchestrator was dispatched to do, and stalls a batch that could already be landing.

Apply the findings in batches (partition by domain/concern per the Concurrency Rules), verify after each batch, and report what was fixed. Only stop to ask when a choice is **genuinely architectural or irreversible** — e.g., two incompatible schema directions, a data migration that can't be rolled back, a dependency that changes the deploy target, or a trade-off the PRD is silent on (then follow Multi-agent conflict resolution). "Which of these 9 lint/logic findings should I fix?" is not such a choice; "should this be event-sourced or CRUD?" is. (Field report #343 F5.)

### Use AskUserQuestion at Genuine Forks

The flip side of the anti-picker rule: when the orchestrator hits a **genuine creative or scope fork** — 2-3 mutually-exclusive directions, none obviously dominant, where guessing wrong means rework — present them with `AskUserQuestion` and an option preview for each, rather than silently picking one or surfacing a single take-it-or-leave-it option. Give each option a short label and a one-line preview of what it commits to (the trade-off, the consequence, what it forecloses), so the user can decide in one read instead of an interview.

Use it for: which of two layouts/IA directions, which scope to ship first when both are valid, an irreversible architectural split, a naming/contract convention that downstream agents will all inherit. Do NOT use it as a substitute for triage you should be doing yourself (see the anti-picker rule above), and do NOT pad it past 3 options — a fork with 6 options usually means the scope wasn't analyzed enough to narrow it. One option presented as a question ("shall I do X?") is also an anti-pattern: either it's the obvious default (just do it) or there's a real alternative (show both). (Field report #351 #5.)

### Standard Agent Brief

Every agent launch MUST include a structured brief:

```
AGENT: [Name] ([Universe])
ROLE: [One sentence]
MISSION: [One sentence]
SCOPE:
  READ: [files/directories]
  WRITE: [files] or NONE (read-only)
CONTEXT: [2-5 sentences from prior phases — NOT raw file contents]
DELIVERABLE FORMAT: [findings-table | change-report | position-statement | build-report]
CONSTRAINTS: [list]
```

### Structured Deliverables (mandatory)

| Agent Type | Deliverable |
|---|---|
| Review / QA / Security | Findings Table: severity, file:line, finding, fix recommendation |
| Fix agents | Change Report: finding ref, file, what changed, verified |
| Architecture / Council | Position Statement: assessment, concerns, sign-off |
| Build agents | Build Report: files created/modified, tests added, decisions made |

### Intentionally Overlapping Mandates (high-signal convergence)

When dispatching parallel reviewers, **deliberately give 3+ agents the same diff with different lenses**. This is not duplication — it is intentional convergence.

- Findings flagged by 1 agent = standard signal, route to triage
- Findings flagged by 2+ agents from different universes = high-confidence signal, prioritize
- Findings flagged by 3+ agents = critical convergence, fix in same batch

Field report #324 (Union Station v7.8 R2): three agents (Discovery + Stark + Kenobi) ran in parallel against the same diff. HIGH-1 was caught by all three; two MED findings by 2 of 3. A single-agent review would have missed ~25% of findings empirically. The "wasted" agent budget is the price of multi-lens coverage.

**When to use overlap:**
- Methodology ADRs (statistical, security, financial) — code-vs-ADR + spec-adversary + Riker trade-offs (3 lenses, same diff)
- Multi-tenant boundary changes — Stark (impl) + Kenobi (auth) + Ahsoka (IDOR) + Spock (schema), 4 lenses on the same code
- Cross-module diffs after refactor sweeps — Cyborg (integration) + Strange (services) + Banner (queries)

**When NOT to use overlap:**
- Trivial single-file changes (<50 lines, no cross-module impact)
- Pure formatting/lint sweeps
- Doc-only edits where finding density approaches zero

### Concurrency Rules (ADR-059)

- **Fan out the full roster in parallel for read-only analysis.** Opus 4.8's 1M context window handles 20+ concurrent findings tables without thrashing. Field report #270 confirmed 15+ parallel agents at 15-25% context usage.
- **No two concurrent agents may write to the same file** — partition by domain/concern, or serialize writes.
- **Fix/build agents:** batch into waves only when writes overlap. Independent files = parallel.
- **Wait for ALL parallel agents before synthesizing** (field report #300).
- Partition strategies: by domain (frontend/backend), by concern (security/UX), or read-only vs. write.

### Directory / Migration Fan-Out: Glob the List, Sweep the Remainder

When a wave fans out per-file or per-entity work across a directory or migration (one agent per file/module/route/migration), two rules are MANDATORY (field report #355 F2):

1. **Derive the per-agent file list from a GLOB, never a hand-typed list.** Run `ls`/`Glob` (e.g., `Glob "src/routes/**/*.ts"`, `git ls-files 'migrations/*.sql'`) and partition the GLOB output into agent assignments. A hand-typed list silently drops the files the orchestrator forgot existed — and those are exactly the ones with the unmigrated legacy pattern, because they weren't top-of-mind. The glob is the source of truth for "what's in scope," not the orchestrator's memory of the tree.
2. **Pair every fan-out with a post-fan-out completeness sweep before the wave is "done."** After all fan-out agents return, run ONE grep for the legacy pattern across the WHOLE target tree (not just the assigned files) — e.g., `grep -rn "oldApiCall(" src/` or `grep -rln "TODO: migrate" .`. A wave is not complete while that grep returns hits. The sweep catches: files the glob/partition missed, files created mid-wave by a parallel agent, and occurrences an agent declared done but left behind. Zero hits is the completion gate, not "all dispatched agents reported done."

The failure mode this prevents: a fan-out reports "9/9 agents complete" while 3 files still carry the legacy pattern — because they were never in the hand-typed list, and nobody grepped the whole tree to confirm. "All my agents finished" is not "the migration is complete." The completeness sweep is the difference. (Field report #355 F2.)

### Registry-Derived Fan-Out: Enumerate the Tuple Set, Diff the Result

The glob-fan-out rule above covers waves where scope is a pattern you can grep (one agent per file matching `src/routes/**/*.ts`). It does NOT cover the other fan-out shape: an **apply wave driven by an accepted-fix registry**, where each unit of work is a `(fixId, targetFile)` tuple and there is no legacy pattern to grep — the target file may be a doc that has never carried the soon-to-be-added rule, so a residual `grep` returns nothing whether the fix landed or not. Two rules are MANDATORY here (field report #363 F3):

1. **Derive the applier work-list from the authoritative accepted-fix registry of `(fixId, targetFile)` tuples — NEVER from memory.** Enumerate every accepted tuple programmatically (the triage verdict table, the issue's "Files That Should Change" rows, the registry the investigate phase produced) and partition *that* into agent assignments. A hand-built per-file list silently drops the tuple that wasn't top-of-mind — and that omitted target's fix simply never gets written. The registry is the source of truth for "what must change," not the orchestrator's recollection of the triage.
2. **After appliers return, `git diff --name-only` and diff the touched files against the accepted `targetFile` set.** Any accepted `targetFile` that is NOT in the diff is an unapplied tuple → re-dispatch its applier or flag it. Completion = **"every accepted targetFile appears in the diff,"** not "all agents reported done." An agent reporting STATUS: Done is not evidence its file changed; the diff is.

The failure mode this prevents: an apply fan-out reports every agent complete while one accepted `(fixId → targetFile)` mapping (e.g., `AI_INTELLIGENCE.md` as a target of a multi-file fix) was omitted from the hand-built work-list and never written. There is no legacy pattern to grep for it — the only proof is the diff coverage check. The earlier the diff-vs-registry assertion runs, the cheaper the catch; left to the pre-commit full-diff review gate, it surfaces but only after the wave declared itself finished. (Field report #363 F3.)

### Context Passing Between Phases

- Pass **findings summaries** between phases, not raw file contents
- The orchestrator distills what matters for the next phase
- Each agent gets only the context it needs, not the full conversation history

### Orchestration Loop

```
PLAN → LAUNCH → WAIT → TRIAGE → DECIDE → REPORT → NEXT
```

### Command-Level Dispatch Specs

| Command | Main Thread | Agents | Parallelism |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/engage` | Partition files, triage findings | 2-3 review agents per round, fix agents | Domain-parallel reads, sequential fixes |
| `/sentinel` | Route findings, manage fixes | Kenobi (full audit), Maul (re-probe) | Sequential (Maul needs Kenobi's fixes) |
| `/qa` | Triage bugs, prioritize | Batman QA + Batman Test | Parallel (different focus) |
| `/assemble` | Full pipeline orchestration | ALL phases dispatched | Wave-batched per phase |
| `/gauntlet` | Round management | 5-8 agents per round | Waves of 3 |
| `/build` | Phase sequencing | Build agents per mission | 2-3 parallel when independent |

### Exception: Trivial Operations

Do NOT dispatch for: <3 files, <10 lines of analysis, single-file edits, git operations, user-facing questions. The 10-second agent launch overhead exceeds the value for trivial ops.

## Anti-Patterns

1. Don't run all agents at once on fresh codebase. Start Picard + Stark, layer others.
2. Don't let agents refactor outside scope.
3. Don't skip handoff checklist.
4. Don't ignore conflicts between agents on same file.
5. Don't forget Batman. Every significant change gets QA.
6. Don't use parallel agents for work that touches the same files — merge conflicts waste more time than sequential work.
7. **Don't do inline analysis when an agent could do it.** Reading 50 files fills context with raw code instead of synthesized findings. Dispatch to an agent, get back a findings table. (Field report #270)
8. **Don't let agents dispatch other agents.** The main thread is the hub. Agent-to-agent dispatch creates coordination chaos.
9. **Don't implement while agents are running.** When agents are deployed in parallel, wait for ALL to return before beginning implementation. Synthesize all findings first, then implement in one batch. Starting early means you miss findings and do rework. (Field report #300)
