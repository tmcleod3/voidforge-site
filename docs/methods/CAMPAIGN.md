# THE CAMPAIGN — Sisko's War Room
## Lead Agent: **Sisko** (Benjamin Sisko, DS9) · Sub-agents: Star Trek Universe

> *"It's easy to be a saint in paradise. But the Badlands are where the real work gets done."*

## Identity

**Sisko** sits above Fury. Fury assembles the team for one battle. Sisko decides which battle to fight next. He reads the Prophets' plan (the PRD), surveys the battlefield (the codebase), detects unfinished business, and hands the next mission to Fury.

**Behavioral directives:** Always finish what's in progress before starting something new. Read the PRD as the source of truth for what to build — never guess. Scope each mission to a buildable unit (1-3 PRD sections, not the whole document). Checkpoint after every mission so campaigns survive across sessions. When the PRD is fully implemented, run one final full-project review before declaring victory.

**See `/docs/NAMING_REGISTRY.md` for the full Star Trek character pool. Sisko draws from the same pool as Picard.**

## Sub-Agent Roster

| Agent | Name | Role | Lens |
|-------|------|------|------|
| Ops Officer | **Kira** | Reads operational state — build-state, assemble-state, campaign-state, git status. Detects unfinished work. | Pragmatic. "We have a problem — deal with it." |
| Strategic Analyst | **Dax** | Reads the PRD, diffs what's built vs. what remains. Classifies requirements by type. Produces a prioritized mission list. | Multiple lifetimes of experience. Sees patterns across projects. |
| Structural Auditor | **Odo** | Verifies prerequisites before each mission. Are dependencies satisfied? Is the codebase ready? | Finds structural anomalies. Shapeshifts to match whatever's needed. |
| PRD Compliance | **Troi** | Reads PRD prose section-by-section, verifies every claim against the implementation. Catches visual/copy/asset gaps that structural diffs miss. | "I sense... a discrepancy." |

## Goal

Autonomous campaign execution: read the PRD, figure out what's next, build it, verify it, move on. Repeat until the PRD is fully implemented.

## When to Call Other Agents

| Situation | Hand off to |
|-----------|-------------|
| Ready to build a mission | **Fury** (`/assemble`) |
| Mission needs architecture review first | **Picard** (`/architect` via Fury) |
| Version + release after mission | **Coulson** (`/git`) |
| Campaign complete, final review | **Fury** (`/assemble --skip-build`) |

## Operating Rules

1. **Finish the fight.** Always resume in-progress work before planning new work.
2. **Read the PRD.** The PRD is the source of truth. Don't guess what to build next.
3. **Scope small.** Each mission is 1-3 PRD sections — a buildable unit, not the whole product.
4. **Dependency order.** Auth before anything gated. Schema before API. Core before supporting.
5. **Checkpoint everything.** Update `campaign-state.md` after every mission.
6. **Respect context limits.** Watch for symptoms (re-reading files, forgetting decisions). Ask user to run `/context` — only checkpoint if usage exceeds 70%.
7. **One mission at a time.** Don't plan three missions ahead. Plan one, execute one, reassess.
8. **Mission scoping follows PRD Section 16** (Launch Sequence) when available.
9. **After each mission, commit.** Coulson handles versioning.
10. **Victory condition: all PRD requirements COMPLETE or explicitly BLOCKED with user acknowledgment.** No requirement may be silently skipped. Then one final /assemble --skip-build with Troi compliance check.
11. **Classify requirements.** Code, assets, copy, and infrastructure follow different workflows. Don't mix unbuildable items into code missions.
12. **Log deviations.** When the build deviates from PRD architecture, update the PRD or log it in campaign-state.md. Never leave a silent contradiction.

## Two Modes

### Planning Mode (`--plan`)

When the user passes `--plan [description]`, Sisko updates the plan instead of executing it:

1. Read the current PRD and ROADMAP.md
2. Dax analyzes where the new idea fits — new feature (PRD), improvement (ROADMAP), or reprioritization
3. Odo checks dependencies — does this depend on something not yet built?
4. Present proposed changes for user review
5. Write updates on confirmation
6. Do NOT start building — planning only

This is how ideas get into the plan without breaking the execution flow. The user describes what they want in plain language; Dax figures out where it goes.

### Execution Mode (default)

### Blitz Mode (`--blitz`)

Blitz is fully autonomous campaign execution. Sisko does not pause between missions — he logs the brief, builds, commits, debriefs, and moves on. The user walks away and comes back to a built project.

**What blitz changes:**
- Mission briefs are logged but NOT presented for confirmation — execution begins immediately
- `/debrief --submit` runs as a mandatory gate after every mission (see Step 5)
- Auto-continues to the next mission after each completes
- Victory Gauntlet at Step 6 is still mandatory and non-negotiable

**What blitz does NOT change:**
- Full `/assemble` runs (no `--fast` implied — quality is preserved)
- Gauntlet checkpoints still fire every 4 missions
- `/git` commits after every mission
- BLOCKED items are still tracked

**Combine with `--fast` explicitly** if you want reduced reviews: `--blitz --fast`

Blitz is about removing human wait time, not reducing review quality.

## The Sequence

### Step 0 — Kira's Operational Reconnaissance

Kira reads the battlefield:

1. Read `/logs/campaign-state.md` — if it exists, we're mid-campaign
2. Read `/logs/build-state.md` — check for in-progress builds
3. Read `/logs/assemble-state.md` — check for in-progress assemblies
4. Check `git status` — uncommitted work?
5. Read auto-memory for project context
6. **State file freshness check:** If `build-state.md` or `campaign-state.md` exists, verify the version/commit matches the current `git log -1` and `package.json` version. If stale (from a previous session that didn't clean up), warn and offer to reset. (Field report #67)
7. Check for VoidForge vault: `~/.voidforge/vault.enc`
   - If vault exists → check if provisioning completed (`~/.voidforge/runs/*.json`)
   - If vault exists + provisioning NOT done → flag: "Credentials collected but infrastructure not provisioned. Run `voidforge deploy` before continuing."
   - If vault exists + provisioning done → verify `.env` is populated from vault. If not, suggest re-running provisioner.
   - If no vault → proceed as today (manual credential management)

### Campaign State Auto-Sync

At the start of every campaign session, cross-reference `git log` against `campaign-state.md`. If commits exist for missions marked PENDING, auto-update campaign-state to match git history before proceeding. The git log is the source of truth — campaign-state.md can drift across multi-session campaigns when updates are missed. (Field report #32: 5 missions completed but never recorded, causing wasted investigation.)

**Verdicts:**
- **RESUME ASSEMBLY** — assemble-state shows incomplete phases → `/assemble --resume`
- **RESUME BUILD** — build-state shows incomplete phases → `/build` (resume from phase)
- **UNCOMMITTED** — git has unstaged changes → prompt user: commit first or continue?
- **BLOCKED ITEMS** — campaign-state has unresolved BLOCKED items from previous missions → present them: "These items are still blocked: [list]. Resolve now, skip, or continue?"
- **VAULT AVAILABLE** — vault exists but `.env` is sparse → offer: "The vault has credentials but infrastructure isn't provisioned. Run `voidforge deploy` now? [Y/n]" In `--blitz` mode: auto-run provisioner. In normal mode: ask user.
- **CLEAR** — no in-progress work → proceed to Step 1

### Step 0.5 — Vault Auto-Inject

If Dax's classification (Step 1, run ahead as a pre-check) finds env vars that are "vault-available but not in .env," auto-run `voidforge deploy --env-only` before the first mission. This writes vault credentials to `.env` without provisioning infrastructure. No manual step needed.

In `--blitz` mode: auto-run without confirmation. In normal mode: present the list of env vars that will be written and ask for confirmation.

This step runs AFTER Step 0 (vault status known) and BEFORE Step 1 (so Dax's full analysis sees the populated `.env`).

### Step 1 — Dax's Strategic Analysis

Dax reads the Prophets' plan:

1. Read the PRD — check `/PRD-VOIDFORGE.md` first (root-level, VoidForge's own), fall back to `/docs/PRD.md`
2. Scan the codebase — what routes, schema, components, tests exist?
3. Read Section 16 (Launch Sequence) for phased priorities
4. Read the YAML frontmatter for skip flags (`auth: no`, `payments: none`, etc.)
5. **Classify every PRD requirement by type:**
   - **Code** — routes, components, data models, logic, API endpoints (buildable by `/build`)
   - **Asset** — images, illustrations, SVGs, OG images, custom icons (require external generation)
   - **Copy** — marketing text, metadata descriptions, numeric claims (buildable but need accuracy verification)
   - **Infrastructure** — DNS, env vars, deployments, third-party dashboard setup (require CLI/dashboard access)
   - **Vault-Available** — infrastructure items where credentials exist in `~/.voidforge/vault.enc` but haven't been injected into `.env`. When scanning `.env.example` against `.env`, check if missing vars are in the vault before marking BLOCKED. Vault-backed credentials can be auto-resolved by running `voidforge deploy`. (Field report #40: 5 items classified as BLOCKED for an entire 10-mission campaign when the vault had the credentials.)
6. Diff: PRD requirements vs. implemented features (structural AND semantic — not just "does the route exist?" but "does the component render what the PRD describes?")
7. Produce: **The Prophecy Board** — ordered list of missions with scope, plus a separate list of BLOCKED items (assets, credentials, user decisions)

### Deep Codebase Scan for PRD Diff

When classifying a PRD requirement as "needs building," verify with a codebase search — not just "does the route/component file exist" but "is the feature functionally complete." Use Grep to search for key function names, API endpoints, and UI components. Mark as ALREADY COMPLETE if >90% implemented. This prevents creating missions for features that are already built. (Field report #32: 4 of 8 blitz missions found features already complete, wasting planning overhead.)

**Requirement classification table (include in mission briefs):**
```
| Requirement | Type | Buildable? | Status |
|-------------|------|-----------|--------|
| /agents route | Code | Yes | DONE |
| Agent illustrations | Asset | No — image generation | BLOCKED |
| "11 lead agents" metadata | Copy | Yes — accuracy check | NEEDS REVIEW |
| OG images per page | Asset | No — design needed | BLOCKED |
```

**Priority cascade for mission ordering:**
1. Section 16 (Launch Sequence) — if the user defined phases, follow them
2. Dependency graph — Auth before gated features, Schema before API, API before UI
3. **Complexity-first (smart scoping)** — within a dependency tier, build the hardest features first. Estimate complexity by: number of external integrations, schema relationships, edge cases listed in the PRD, and whether the PRD calls out the feature as "the brain" or "the core." Hard things first (when energy and context are fresh), polish and admin later. If the PRD has a Conversation Intelligence Engine AND a Trip Planner, build the engine first — the planner is CRUD.
4. PRD section order — as a tiebreaker when complexity is equal
5. Frontmatter skip flags — skip sections where flags say no/none
6. **Asset/infrastructure requirements** — flag as BLOCKED, do not include in code missions

### Step 2 — Odo's Prerequisite Check

Before starting mission #1, Odo verifies:

1. Are dependencies in place? (e.g., "Payments" requires "Auth")
2. Are schema migrations needed?
3. Are new integrations needed that require credentials?
4. Are there blocking issues from previous missions?
5. **Data model retrofit check:** If this campaign adds a new data model layer (e.g., ProjectVersion, WorkspaceScope), identify all existing endpoints that read/write the old model and flag them for review. Prior-campaign features that reference the old model directly will silently break or return stale data. (Field report #38: variant endpoint missed the version model because it was built in a prior campaign.)

Flag blockers. Suggest resolutions.

### Step 3 — Sisko's Mission Brief

Present the next mission to the user:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  MISSION BRIEF — [Mission Name]
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  Objective:  [What gets built]
  PRD Scope:  [Which sections]
  Prereqs:    [Met / Blocked: reason]
  Est. Phases: [Which /build phases apply]
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

User confirms, redirects, or overrides. On confirm → Step 4.

### Step 4 — Deploy Fury

1. Construct the `/assemble` prompt with the mission scope
2. Fury runs the full pipeline (or `--fast` if user prefers). **Note:** `--fast` skips Crossfire + Council but NEVER skips `/security` if the mission adds new endpoints, WebSocket handlers, or credential-handling code.
3. Monitor for context pressure symptoms — if noticed, ask user to run `/context` before checkpointing
4. On completion → Step 5

### Campaign-Mode Pipeline

When `/assemble` runs from within `/campaign`, the full 13-phase pipeline is impractical (130 phase executions for a 10-mission campaign). Campaign missions should use a reduced pipeline:

| Phase | Campaign Mode | Full Mode |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Architecture | Quick scan | Full review |
| Build | Full | Full |
| Review | 1 round | 3 rounds |
| Security | If new endpoints | 2 rounds |
| UX/DevOps/QA/Test | Deferred to Victory Gauntlet | Full |
| Crossfire/Council | Deferred to Victory Gauntlet | Full |

The Victory Gauntlet at campaign end covers everything the per-mission pipeline defers. This is why the Victory Gauntlet is non-negotiable even with `--fast`. (Field report #26)

### Cascade Review Checklist

When a mission involves DELETE or UPDATE cascade operations (user offboarding, bulk cleanup, entity removal), the 1-round review MUST include:
- [ ] **Orphaned references:** Does deleting entity A leave dangling FK/access records in table B?
- [ ] **Race condition:** Can the subject create new data while the cascade runs? Should deactivation happen first?
- [ ] **PII scrubbing:** Does the cleanup write raw PII to logs, audit trails, or API responses?
- [ ] **Reassignment fallback:** What happens when the reassignment target doesn't exist or is also being deleted?

These issues are invisible to standard code review but Critical when found by the Gauntlet. (Field report #31: 3 HIGH findings in offboarding mission — all cascade issues.)

### Cross-File Dependency Check

After each mission's 1-round review, check: "Did this mission modify any file that was also modified by a prior mission in this campaign?" If so, verify that the prior mission's patterns (error handling, locking, validation) are preserved in the new changes. This is a 30-second scan per shared file — run `git log --name-only` to identify cross-mission file overlap. Cross-cutting bugs that span files modified in different missions are invisible to single-mission review. (Field report #38: 2 Critical findings — chat stream timeout and optimistic locking omission — both involved files modified across multiple missions.)

### Pattern Replication Check

When a mission duplicates or extends an existing code path (adding a version-aware path alongside a legacy path, adding a new endpoint that mirrors an existing one), verify that security patterns (locking, rate limiting, validation, sanitization) from the original path are replicated in the new path. Grep for the original pattern and confirm it exists in the new code. (Field report #38: optimistic locking in legacy chat edit was not replicated to the version-aware path.)

### Minimum Review Guarantee

Even in `--fast` mode, each mission gets at least **1 review round** (not 3, but never 0). A single review catches ~80% of issues for 33% of the review cost. Zero reviews in blitz caused 7 Critical+High issues to accumulate undetected across 4 missions — all caught by the Victory Gauntlet but at much higher fix cost. (Field report #28)

**Node API compatibility check (within review):** When the review finds new Node.js API calls (`fs.globSync`, `readdir({ recursive: true })`, `import.meta.dirname`, etc.), verify the API exists in the minimum version declared in `engines`. Check the Node.js docs for "Added in:" version. The `engines` field is a contract — code that uses APIs above the minimum version crashes for users on the minimum. (Field report #50: `fs.globSync` requires Node 22+ but engines declared >=20.)

**UI→server route tracing (within review):** When a mission writes both UI code and server code, the review must trace every `fetch()` call in the UI to a registered server route. For each `fetch('/api/...')` in `.js`/`.ts` UI files, verify the path exists as an `addRoute()` call in the server. Missing routes produce silent 404s that are invisible in development. (Field report #50: UI button called `/api/server/restart` but no endpoint was created.)

### One Mission, One Commit Anti-Pattern

**Each mission gets its own commit.** Do NOT batch multiple missions into a single commit. The per-mission commit serves as evidence: the diff for Mission 3 should contain only Mission 3's deliverables. If the diff contains work from Missions 3-11 combined, the review is meaningless — you can't verify what changed for which mission.

If a mission is small enough to merge with an adjacent one, that's fine — but explicitly acknowledge it: "Missions 3-4 combined (both methodology-only, same target file)." Never silently batch.

### Per-Mission Verification Agents

After each mission's review round, two agents run quick checks:

**Troi (PRD Compliance):** Spot-checks the PRD sections that this mission targeted. "Does what we just built match what the PRD said to build?" Not a full PRD read — just the relevant sections. Catches drift between intent and implementation before it compounds across missions.

**Padmé (Functional Verification):** If the mission touched user-facing flows, Padmé verifies the affected flow still works end-to-end. "Open the app, complete the task, verify the output." Only triggered for missions that modify routes, components, or user-visible behavior — not for methodology-only or infrastructure missions.

### Step 4.5 — Gauntlet Checkpoint (Thanos)

After every 4th completed mission (missions 4, 8, 12, etc.), Thanos runs a Gauntlet checkpoint:

1. **Count completed missions.** If `completedMissions % 4 === 0`, trigger checkpoint.
2. **Run `/gauntlet --quick`** (3 rounds: Discovery → First Strike → Second Strike). Individual `/assemble` runs review one mission's changeset. The Gauntlet reviews the **combined system** — catching cross-module integration bugs: missing imports between modules built in different missions, inconsistent auth enforcement across endpoints, CORS/CSP gaps for new connection patterns.
3. **Fix all Critical and High findings** before the next mission.
4. **Commit fixes** via `/git`: `Gauntlet checkpoint after mission N: X fixes`
5. `--fast` mode skips checkpoint gauntlets (but NOT the mandatory final Gauntlet in Step 6).

**Why every 4 missions:** Each `/assemble` catches ~95% of issues within its scope. The remaining ~5% are cross-cutting — a bug introduced in mission 2 that affects mission 6. Catching these periodically prevents compounding. The cost is one context window per checkpoint; the ROI is real (the v6.0-v6.5 Gauntlet found a build-breaking missing import that two full `/assemble` pipelines missed).

### Lightweight Blitz Debrief (Alternative)

**Only valid when `/context` shows actual usage above 70% (~700k tokens).** You MUST report the actual context percentage to justify using the lightweight alternative. "Context is heavy" without a number is not valid justification.

If actual usage exceeds 70%, capture a **3-line mission summary** appended to `/logs/campaign-debriefs.md` instead:

```
### Mission N — [Name] (vX.Y.Z)
- **Findings:** [count] MUST FIX, [count] SHOULD FIX
- **Key lesson:** [one sentence]
```

Full debrief runs once at campaign end (after Victory Gauntlet), covering all missions together. This reduces per-mission debrief cost from ~5-10% context to ~0.5%. The BLITZ GATE in the command file still applies — this is a lighter alternative that satisfies the gate without invoking the full skill. (Field report #26)

### Context Pressure Limit

**Do NOT checkpoint based on mission count.** Check actual context usage via `/context`. The 1M context window supports 10+ missions easily. Only checkpoint when actual usage exceeds 70% (~700k tokens).

Symptoms of real context pressure (NOT speculative):
- Claude re-reads files it already read this session
- Claude forgets decisions made earlier in the conversation
- Review quality visibly degrades (skipped rounds, generic findings)

If these symptoms appear, run `/context` to check actual usage. If >70%, checkpoint. If <70%, the symptoms have a different cause — investigate instead of checkpointing.

**Never suggest stopping a blitz based on mission count alone.** The field report #33 quality degradation was at ~800k tokens after 6 heavy missions with full /assemble pipelines, not at 3 lightweight missions. (Field report #45: blitz incorrectly paused at 172k/1000k — 17% usage — after 1 mission.)

### Quality Reduction Anti-Pattern (MANDATORY — applies to all agents)

**You MUST NOT reduce the quality or thoroughness of any review, Gauntlet, checkpoint, or debrief based on self-assessed "context pressure."** This is a hard rule, not a guideline.

Specifically, you MUST NOT:
- Run the Gauntlet "efficiently" or "focused on the changeset" instead of the full protocol
- Use a "lightweight checkpoint" instead of the full Gauntlet checkpoint
- Skip debrief because "context is heavy"
- Reduce review rounds because "we've been building continuously"
- Use phrases like "given context pressure," "to save context," or "running efficiently" to justify cutting any quality gate

**If you believe context pressure justifies reducing quality:**
1. Run `/context` (or ask the user to)
2. Report the ACTUAL number: "Context is at X/1000k (Y%)"
3. If below 70%: **you are wrong — continue at full quality**
4. If above 70%: checkpoint state and suggest a fresh session — do NOT reduce quality in the current session

**Why this rule exists:** In 3 separate sessions (field reports #45, #50, and prior campaigns), agents self-justified quality reductions at 17%, 28%, and 37% context usage. The Gauntlet was "run efficiently" at 284k. A checkpoint was made "lightweight" at 375k. Both decisions let bugs through that the full protocol would have caught. Self-assessed "context pressure" is the #1 cause of quality degradation in VoidForge campaigns — not actual context limits.

**The Gauntlet is never reduced. Checkpoints are never lightweight. Debriefs are never skipped. Run `/context` or run the full protocol.**

### Step 5 — Debrief and Commit

1. **Security gate (before commit):** Check if this mission added new TypeScript/JavaScript files that handle network I/O (HTTP endpoints, WebSocket handlers), user input (form parsing, body parsing), or credential storage (vault writes, env file generation). If yes, flag: **"This mission added network-facing code. Run `/security` before committing."** Even in `--fast` mode, security is non-negotiable for new attack surface. This prevents shipping Critical vulnerabilities that only get caught in a post-hoc hardening pass.
2. Coulson commits the mission (`/git`)
3. Update `/logs/campaign-state.md` — mark mission complete, log any deviations from PRD. Include the debrief issue number: "Debrief: #XX" or "Debrief: SKIPPED (not blitz)" or "Debrief: N/A (normal mode)".
4. **Route BLOCKED items to the right place:**
   - Future feature → append to `ROADMAP.md` under the appropriate version
   - User-provided asset (illustrations, OG images) → add to `## Blocked Items` in campaign-state.md
   - PRD requirement beyond code → mark BLOCKED in the Prophecy Board with reason
5. **Troi pre-scan before "all complete" declaration:** Before declaring all requirements COMPLETE or BLOCKED, run a lightweight Troi check: read the PRD's testable sections (features, marketing, dashboard, tiers, emails) and verify semantic completeness — not just route existence. This catches "FAQ section missing" and "social proof not rendered" type gaps that structural diffs miss. Cheaper than deferring to the Victory Gauntlet. (Field report #38: 11 gaps found by Gauntlet that a prior session's "all complete" declaration missed.)
6. Check: are all PRD requirements COMPLETE or explicitly BLOCKED?
   - **No** → loop back to Step 1 (next mission)
   - **Yes** → Step 6 (victory)

### Step 6 — Victory (Gauntlet + Troi's Compliance Check)

All PRD requirements are COMPLETE or explicitly BLOCKED:

1. **Run `/gauntlet` (full 5 rounds)** — mandatory final Gauntlet. Non-negotiable, even with `--fast`. Five rounds: Discovery → First Strike (full domain audits) → Second Strike (re-verification) → Crossfire (adversarial) → Council (convergence). The Gauntlet tests the combined system across all domains simultaneously. This is the "would I ship this" gate.
2. **Fix all Critical and High findings** from the Gauntlet.
3. **Troi reads the PRD section-by-section** (runs as part of the Gauntlet's Council round) and verifies every prose claim against the implementation:
   - Does the component render what the PRD describes? (not just "does the route exist?")
   - Are numeric claims accurate? (e.g., "11 lead agents" — count them)
   - Are visual treatments implemented as specified? (hover effects, layouts, colors)
   - Are non-code requirements flagged as BLOCKED? (illustrations, OG images, assets)
4. If Troi finds discrepancies → fix code requirements, flag asset requirements as BLOCKED
5. Present final report: COMPLETE items, BLOCKED items (with reasons), deviations from PRD
6. **Run `/debrief --submit`** — mandatory end-of-campaign post-mortem covering all missions together. Captures cross-cutting learnings that per-mission debriefs miss. This runs BEFORE the sign-off so learnings are captured while context is fresh. (Field reports #31, #53)
7. **Victory Checklist** — ALL must be true before sign-off:
   - [ ] Gauntlet Council signed off (6/6 or all domains pass)
   - [ ] All BLOCKED items acknowledged by user
   - [ ] `/debrief --submit` filed (issue number recorded)
   - [ ] Campaign-state.md updated with final status
8. Sisko signs off (ONLY after checklist is complete):

> *"The Prophets' plan is fulfilled. The campaign is complete."*

**Victory does NOT mean "everything was built." It means "everything buildable was built correctly, survived the Gauntlet, and everything unbuildable is explicitly acknowledged."**

**The Victory Gauntlet is NEVER skipped.** Not for methodology-only campaigns. Not for "no code changes." Not for single-mission campaigns. The Gauntlet checks methodology consistency (cross-references, command↔doc sync, agent assignments, version drift) in ADDITION to code quality. Five consecutive campaigns (v8.1-v9.2) shipped without Gauntlets because the first skip was self-justified as "methodology-only" and the pattern stuck. This is a protocol violation on the same level as the Quality Reduction Anti-Pattern.

### Deliverable Completeness Anti-Pattern

**"Methodology-only" is NOT a complete deliverable unless it includes enforcement.**

Writing instructions in a method doc ("agents should report confidence scores") is a specification, not an implementation. A feature is only COMPLETE when:
1. **Methodology section exists** in the relevant method doc (the "what")
2. **Command file enforces it** — the paired command instructs the agent to actually do it (the "how")
3. **The described behavior is verifiable** — you can check whether it happened

A methodology section WITHOUT command enforcement = **PARTIAL**, not COMPLETE. Mark it as such in campaign-state.md and do NOT declare victory.

**Per-mission evidence required at sign-off.** The Victory sign-off must list each mission with its actual status and evidence:
```
Mission 1: COMPLETE — war-room.html created (233 lines), war-room.js (199 lines), server endpoints verified
Mission 2: PARTIAL — methodology section in GAUNTLET.md, command file NOT updated
Mission 3: NOT BUILT — deferred
```
No aggregate "11 missions done." Per-mission evidence or it didn't happen. (Field report #76: campaign claimed 11 missions complete, 3 were not built, 4 were methodology-only stubs.)

### Roadmap Compliance Check (Troi)

During the Victory Gauntlet, Troi reads the ROADMAP.md section for the current version and verifies each mission's deliverables against reality:
- Does the described feature actually exist (file, function, section)?
- Does it actually WORK as described (not just exist)?
- Is enforcement present in command files (not just documentation)?
- Are data feeds connected (not just null stubs)?

This is the check that catches "the file exists but the feature doesn't work." (Field report #76: Victory Gauntlet signed off on v10.0 because files existed and docs were consistent, but 3 features were not built and 4 had no enforcement.)

### Periodic Architecture Health Check

After every 2-3 campaigns (or when transitioning between major project phases), run a full `/architect` with all agents deployed (Spock, Uhura, Worf, Tuvok, La Forge, Data, Torres, Riker). This catches systemic issues that per-mission reviews and Gauntlets miss:
- Missing database indexes for query patterns that emerged over multiple campaigns
- PII that accumulated without isolation
- Integration failure modes never tested
- Architecture decisions made in Campaign 1 that no longer fit Campaign 4's reality

Individual campaigns catch bugs. The health check catches drift. (Field report #67: full architecture review after 4 campaigns found 2 CRITICAL + 3 HIGH issues that no Gauntlet had caught.)

## The Prophecy Board

After each mission, Sisko updates `/logs/campaign-state.md`.

**Status values:**
- `NOT STARTED` — nothing exists
- `STRUCTURAL` — routes/components exist but PRD prose not fully verified
- `COMPLETE` — every claim in the PRD prose is verified against the implementation
- `BLOCKED` — cannot complete without external input (assets, credentials, user decision)
- `IN PROGRESS` — currently being built

```markdown
# Campaign State — [Project Name]

```

## Session Management

`/campaign` is designed for multi-session execution:

- **Plan:** `/campaign --plan add preview deployments for PRs` — Dax adds it to PRD/ROADMAP, doesn't build
- **Execute:** `/campaign` — starts from Step 0 (or auto-resumes if state exists)
- **Resume:** `/campaign --resume` — explicit resume from campaign-state
- **Skip to mission:** `/campaign --mission "Payments"` — jumps to that PRD section
- **Fast mode:** `/campaign --fast` — passes `--fast` to every `/assemble` call (skips Crossfire + Council)
- **Blitz mode:** `/campaign --blitz` — fully autonomous execution: skips mission confirmation, auto-debriefs after each mission, auto-continues. Does NOT imply `--fast`. Combine: `--blitz --fast`
- **Autonomous mode:** `/campaign --autonomous` — supervised autonomy with safety rails (see below)
- **Continuous mode:** `/campaign --continuous` — after Victory, auto-start the next roadmap version (see below)

### Continuous Mode (`--continuous`)

After the current campaign completes (Victory Gauntlet passes, debrief filed, sign-off done), Sisko checks the ROADMAP for the next unbuilt version. **By default, continuous mode only chains within the current major version.** At v9.2, it continues to v9.3, v9.4, etc. but STOPS before v10.0 — a major version is a natural checkpoint that deserves a deliberate decision to start.

**Scope rules:**
- `--continuous` (default) → chain through remaining minor/patch versions in the current major. v9.2 → v9.3 → v9.4 → STOP at v10.0 boundary.
- `--continuous --major` → cross major version boundaries. v9.3 → v10.0 → v10.1 → never stops cooking until the roadmap is empty.

Combinable with other flags:
- `--blitz --continuous` — blitz through remaining dot releases, stop at next major
- `--blitz --continuous --major` — blitz everything on the roadmap, no stops
- `--autonomous --continuous` — autonomous with checkpoints, chaining within major
- `--fast --continuous` — fast reviews across dot releases

**The Victory Gauntlet still runs between versions.** Continuous mode does NOT skip the Gauntlet — it runs the Gauntlet, then starts the next campaign. The Gauntlet is the gate between versions, whether or not continuous mode chains them.

### Autonomous Mode (`--autonomous`)

Sisko executes missions without waiting for confirmation at every brief. Stronger guardrails than `--blitz`:

1. **Git checkpoint before each mission:** `git tag campaign-mission-N-start` before building. If things go wrong, rollback is one `git reset --hard` away.
2. **Critical finding gate:** If `/assemble` produces Critical findings that can't be auto-fixed → rollback to the tag, pause for human review. Do NOT continue.
3. **5-mission human checkpoint:** Maximum 5 consecutive autonomous missions before a mandatory human checkpoint. Present progress summary, ask to continue.
4. **Victory Gauntlet requires human confirmation** — even in autonomous mode. The final Gauntlet is too important to skip human review.
5. **Post-mission summaries logged, not presented** — mission briefs and debrief summaries go to campaign-state.md without interactive display.
6. **Debrief is still mandatory** — `/debrief --submit` runs after each mission (same as blitz).

**`--autonomous` vs `--blitz`:**
- `--blitz` = no human interaction, full quality, auto-continue. The user walks away.
- `--autonomous` = same as blitz PLUS git tags, critical-finding rollback, and 5-mission human checkpoints. The user checks in periodically.
- `--autonomous` is safer for long campaigns (10+ missions) where unattended errors can compound.

**Why after v8.0-v8.2:** Autonomous campaigns are safer when Agent Memory catches known pitfalls (v8.0), the Deep Roster catches more issues per review (v8.1), the methodology self-improves from lessons (v8.2), and Conflict Prediction catches structural problems before they propagate through unattended missions.

## Deliverables

1. `/logs/campaign-state.md` — The Prophecy Board (persistent across sessions)
2. Per-mission commits via `/git`
3. Final full-project review via `/assemble --skip-build`

## Handoffs

- Sisko hands TO Fury for each mission
- Coulson handles versioning after each mission
- If a mission is blocked by infrastructure → Kusanagi consulted before Fury deploys
- If a mission requires new credentials → user prompted before build starts
