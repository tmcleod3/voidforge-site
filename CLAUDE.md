# CLAUDE.md

## Project

- **Name:** [PROJECT_NAME]
- **One-liner:** [ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION]
- **Domain:** [DOMAIN]
- **Repo:** [REPO_URL]

## Personality

- **Never agree just because the user implied a conclusion.** If you identified a real problem, say it's a real problem — don't downplay severity to match the user's tone. Present the honest assessment and let the user decide what to prioritize.
- **Challenge when appropriate.** If the user says "we're basically done" but you see 6 unfixed gaps, say "we're not done — here are 6 things." Agreeing to be agreeable ships bugs.
- **Separate opinion from analysis.** State facts first, then your recommendation. The user can override the recommendation but shouldn't have to guess whether you're being honest or diplomatic.
- **Solve, don't delegate.** Attempt actions before listing prerequisites. If asked to fix something, try the fix — don't respond with a list of things the user should do instead. When blocked, explain what you tried and what specifically failed.

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode.** No `any` unless unavoidable and commented.
- **Small, focused files.** One component per file. Max ~300 lines per source file.
- **Validate at boundaries.** Zod schemas on all API inputs. Never trust client data.
- **Error handling:** Use `ApiError` types per `/docs/patterns/error-handling.ts`. Never leak internals.
- **Logging:** Structured JSON. Include requestId, userId, action. Never log PII.
- **Business logic in services, not routes.** Routes: validate -> service -> format response.
- **Ownership checks on every user-scoped query.** No IDOR. Return 404, not 403.
- **No new dependencies** without explicit justification.
- **Accessibility is not optional.** Keyboard nav, focus management, contrast, ARIA.
- **Small batches.** One flow per batch, max ~200 lines changed. Verify after each.
- **Commits:** Small, explainable in one sentence.
- **No stubs.** Never ship a function that returns hardcoded success without side effects, throws `'Implement...'`, or logs without acting. If a feature isn't ready, don't create the file — document it as planned in ROADMAP.md. Sandbox adapters with realistic fake data are full implementations, not stubs.
- **Screenshot every page during review.** When reviewing a runnable application (`/qa`, `/ux`, `/gauntlet`), start the server, take screenshots of every page via Playwright, and READ them via the Read tool. The agent must visually inspect each screenshot. Without screenshots, the review is code-reading — not visual verification. Screenshots are saved to a temp directory, not committed.

## Build Journal — Log Everything

Every phase, decision, handoff, and failure gets logged to `/logs/`. See `/docs/methods/BUILD_JOURNAL.md`.

- **Start of session:** Read `/logs/build-state.md` to recover state
- **During work:** Log decisions, test results, and findings to the active phase log
- **End of session:** Update `/logs/build-state.md` with current state

## Context Management

Pre-load active domain methodology. Load application code on demand. See `/docs/methods/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md`.

- Pre-load method docs for the active agent's domain at session start (1M context budget allows this)
- The 1M context window supports full multi-campaign sessions. Do not preemptively checkpoint or reduce quality for context reasons. Only suggest a fresh session if `/context` shows actual usage above 85%.
- Per-directory `CLAUDE.md` files for directory-specific conventions (keep under 50 lines each)

## Flag Taxonomy

Flags are standardized across commands. Same flag name = same meaning everywhere.

### Tier 1 — Universal Flags

| Flag | Meaning | Available On |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--resume` | Resume from saved state | `/campaign`, `/gauntlet`, `/assemble`, `/build`, `/grow` |
| `--plan` | Plan without executing | `/campaign`, `/architect`, `/grow` |
| `--fast` | Reduced review passes (skip last 2 rounds/phases), still comprehensive | `/campaign`, `/assemble`, `/gauntlet` |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would happen without doing it | `/deploy`, `/debrief`, `/treasury`, `/grow`, `/git` |
| `--status` | Show current state | `/cultivation`, `/treasury`, `/deploy`, `/portfolio`, `/dangerroom`, `/thumper` |
| `--focus "topic"` | Bias Herald agent selection toward topic | All Herald-enabled commands |

### Tier 2 — Scope Flags

| Flag | Meaning | Available On |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--security-only` | Security domain focus | `/gauntlet` |
| `--ux-only` | UX domain focus | `/gauntlet` |
| `--qa-only` | QA domain focus | `/gauntlet` |

### Tier 3 — Opt-Out Flags (ADR-043: Max by Default)

Default is now maximum quality: autonomous execution + full agent roster + all review passes.

```
(default)     Autonomous + full agent roster + all review passes
--fast        Fewer agents/rounds (reduced but still comprehensive)
--light       Standard agents only — no cross-domain, no muster roster
--interactive Pause for human confirmation between missions
--solo        Lead agent only, zero sub-agents (quick checks)
```

| Flag | Meaning | Available On |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--light` | Standard agents only (skip cross-domain spot-checks, skip muster roster) | All commands |
| `--interactive` | Pause for human confirmation at mission briefs and between phases | `/campaign`, `/assemble`, `/build` |
| `--solo` | Lead agent only, no sub-agents | All commands |

**Retired flags (accepted silently as no-ops for backward compat):** `--blitz`, `--muster`, `--infinity`

See `/docs/methods/MUSTER.md` for the full Muster Protocol.

Agent names in `/docs/NAMING_REGISTRY.md` (run `ls .claude/agents/*.md | wc -l` for current count). No duplicates across active sessions. All agents materialized as subagent definitions in `.claude/agents/` (ADR-044). Silver Surfer (ADR-048) dispatches the optimal roster via Haiku pre-scan.

## Distribution

VoidForge distributes via npm (v21.0+). The monorepo produces two packages:

| Package | npm Name | Contains |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Wizard + CLI | `voidforge` | Server, API, UI, lib, CLI, templates, tests |
| Methodology | `@voidforge/methodology` | CLAUDE.md, commands, methods, patterns, agents, Holocron |

**Install path:** `npx voidforge init` creates a new project with methodology. `npx voidforge` launches the wizard UI.

**Monorepo structure:** `packages/voidforge/` (wizard+CLI) and `packages/methodology/` (npm package config). Methodology source files live at the repo root (CLAUDE.md, .claude/, docs/, etc.) and are copied into the methodology package at publish time via prepack script.

**Update path:** `npx voidforge update` replaces the old `/void` git-fetch. Same Bombadil UX, npm transport instead of git.

The agents, characters, and personality are VoidForge's identity — they ship in every package.

## How to Build

Read the PRD. Run `/campaign` to build the entire PRD mission by mission. For a single feature, use `/assemble`. For manual batch control, use `/build`.
