#
# Writes a session-scoped bypass flag that check.sh honors. Fail-closed on
# unknown flag values (SEC-003 fix) — only --light and --solo are valid.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/surfer-gate/bypass.sh --light
#   bash scripts/surfer-gate/bypass.sh --solo
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = bypass recorded, or hook inactive (no-op)
#   2 = rejected: unknown flag value (SEC-003 fail-closed)
