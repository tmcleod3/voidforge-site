## Version History

| Version | Date | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| 23.9.2 | 2026-04-20 | CI workflow idempotency + provenance baseline — `publish.yml` guards each publish with "already-published" check so re-runs skip cleanly. Tag-push re-publishes via CI to attach npm provenance attestation (absent on v23.9.1's manual publish). |
| 23.9.1 | 2026-04-20 | ADR-061 pivot — `@voidforge` npm org unavailable (squat-adjacent). Rebranded publish target to `voidforge-build` / `voidforge-build-methodology` matching the voidforge.build domain. Migration banner for legacy `thevoidforge` / `@voidforge/cli` installs. Farewell releases + npm deprecate for smooth transition. |
| 23.9.0 | 2026-04-20 | Campaign 42 — @voidforge scoped npm rename (ADR-061), gauntlet --fast 3-round mandate, README value-prop + first-command pointer, LEARNINGS.md 4 entries. Victory Gauntlet 3 fix batches: methodology runtime dep, registry-pin + env-stripping, BLOCK absolute paths. Publish gated on user scope claim + NPM_TOKEN rotation. |
