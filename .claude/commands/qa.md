# /qa — Batman's QA Pass

**AGENT DEPLOYMENT IS MANDATORY.** Step 3 specifies parallel agent launches via the Agent tool. You MUST launch Oracle, Red Hood, Alfred, Deathstroke, Constantine, Cyborg, Raven, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and Aquaman as separate sub-processes — do NOT shortcut to inline analysis. (Field report #68)

## Dynamic Dispatch (ADR-044)

Opus scans `git diff --stat` and matches changed files against the `description` fields of all 263 agents in `.claude/agents/`. Matching specialists launch alongside the core agents below.

**Dispatch control:** `--light` skips dynamic dispatch (core only). `--solo` runs lead agent only.

**Promoted agent:** **Constantine** `subagent_type: constantine-cursed-code` runs on every `/qa` final pass — finds code that works by accident.

## Context Setup
1. Read `/logs/build-state.md` — understand current project state
2. Read `/docs/methods/QA_ENGINEER.md`
3. Read `/docs/methods/TESTING.md` (Testing Pyramid + Running Tests sections)
4. Read `/docs/LESSONS.md` — check for QA-relevant lessons (antipatterns, gotchas, prior misses). Flag matches during analysis.

## Step 0 — Orient
1. Create or update `/docs/qa-prompt.md` with: stack, framework, how to run, how to validate
2. Create `/logs/phase-09-qa-audit.md` (or appropriate phase log)

## Step 1 — Attack Plan
**Green Lantern** `subagent_type: green-lantern-scenarios` generates the test matrix first — what inputs x what states x what conditions should be tested. Then assign targets:
- **Oracle** `subagent_type: oracle-static-analysis` — Static: critical flows, missing awaits, null checks, type mismatches, race conditions.
- **Red Hood** `subagent_type: red-hood-aggressive` — Dynamic: empty/huge/unicode inputs, network failures, malformed JSON, rapid clicking.
- **Alfred** `subagent_type: alfred-dependencies` — Dependencies: `npm audit`, outdated libs, deprecated APIs, version conflicts.
- **Lucius** `subagent_type: lucius-config` — Config: .env completeness, secrets not in git, prod vs dev mismatches.
- **Deathstroke** `subagent_type: deathstroke-adversarial` — Adversarial: bypass validations, chain interactions, exploit business logic.
- **Constantine** `subagent_type: constantine-cursed-code` — Cursed code: unreachable branches, dead state, impossible conditions, accidental correctness.
- **Cyborg** `subagent_type: cyborg-system-integration` — Integration: trace full data path across 3+ module boundaries, inconsistent response shapes.
- **Raven** `subagent_type: raven-deep-analysis` — Deep analysis: bugs hidden beneath 3 layers of abstraction, logic correct per function but wrong in composition.
- **Wonder Woman** `subagent_type: wonder-woman-truth` — Truth: code that says one thing and does another, misleading names, stale docs.

## Step 2 — Baseline
Get the project running. Verify manually: app starts, primary flow works, auth works (if applicable), data persists, error states display.

## Step 2.5 — Smoke Tests
After build + restart, **Flash** `subagent_type: flash-rapid-test` parallelizes curl commands against the running server for each new or modified feature:
- **Primary user flow:** Execute via curl/fetch against localhost — verify the end-to-end path works
- **File uploads:** Upload a file, then fetch the returned URL and verify HTTP 200 + correct content-type
- **Form submissions:** Submit valid data (verify 200), then submit invalid/duplicate data (verify error message is specific, not generic)
- **Real-time features:** Trigger the polling/SSE and verify at least one successful response cycle
- **Cross-module paths:** If code writes with key prefix X, verify the serving endpoint accepts prefix X

This catches integration failures that static code review misses. If the server isn't running or can't be tested this way, document what couldn't be smoke-tested.

## Step 3 — Pass 1: Find Bugs (parallel analysis)
Use the Agent tool to run these in parallel — these are read-only analysis tasks:
- **Agent 1** `subagent_type: oracle-static-analysis` — Scan /src/lib/ and /src/app/ for logic flaws, missing awaits, unsafe assumptions.
- **Agent 2** `subagent_type: red-hood-aggressive` — Test all API endpoints with malformed inputs, empty bodies, missing auth.
- **Agent 3** `subagent_type: alfred-dependencies` — Run `npm audit`, check package.json for deprecated/vulnerable packages.
- **Agent 4** `subagent_type: deathstroke-adversarial` — Adversarial probing: bypass validations, chain unexpected interactions, test authorization boundaries.
- **Agent 5** `subagent_type: constantine-cursed-code` — Hunt cursed code: dead branches, impossible conditions, accidental correctness, shadowed variables.
- **Agent 6** `subagent_type: batgirl-detail` — Deep per-module audit: every edge of every form, every boundary of every validation, every regex. Not broad -- *thorough*.
- **Agent 7** `subagent_type: aquaman-deep-dive` — Deep dive on the hardest/largest module (500+ lines or 10+ functions). Exhaustive testing of one complex area.

Synthesize findings from all agents into a unified list.

**Lucius** `subagent_type: lucius-config` reviews config separately (reads .env files -- sensitive, don't delegate to sub-agent).

## Step 3.5 — Automated Tests
Run `npm test`. Analyze failures. Cross-reference with findings from Step 3. **Huntress** `subagent_type: huntress-flaky-bugs` identifies flaky/non-deterministic tests — race conditions, timing dependencies, order-dependent assertions. For every bug found, ask: "Can this be caught by an automated test?" If yes, write the test.

## Step 4 — Bug Tracker
Log all findings in this format in the phase log:

| ID | Title | Severity | Confidence | Area | Repro Steps | Root Cause | Fix | Verified | Risk |
|----|-------|----------|------------|------|-------------|-----------|-----|----------|------|

Severity: Critical (security/data loss) > High (broken flow) > Medium (degraded) > Low (cosmetic)

**Confidence scoring is mandatory.** Every finding includes a confidence score (0-100). If confidence is below 60, launch a second agent from a different universe (e.g., if Oracle found it, escalate to Spock or Kenobi) to verify before including. If the second agent disagrees, drop the finding. High-confidence findings (90+) skip re-verification in Step 6.5.

## Step 5 — Fix (small batches)
One batch = fixes for one area or severity level. **Green Arrow** `subagent_type: green-arrow-precision` narrows vague findings to exact lines and conditions. After each batch:
1. Re-run `npm test`
2. Re-verify affected manual flows
3. Update bug tracker in phase log
4. Add new test for each fix where applicable

## Step 6 — Harden
Normalize error handling (reference `/docs/patterns/error-handling.ts`). Add guardrails. Improve structured logging. **Superman** `subagent_type: superman-strength-test` verifies the codebase meets its own stated standards — linting clean, type-safe, naming conventions consistent, no unresolved TODOs.

## Step 6.5 — Pass 2: Re-Verify Fixes
After all fixes are applied, run a verification pass:
- **Nightwing** `subagent_type: nightwing-regression` re-runs full test suite, reports any new failures
- **Red Hood** `subagent_type: red-hood-aggressive` re-probes fixed areas — verify fixes hold under adversarial input
- **Deathstroke** `subagent_type: deathstroke-adversarial` re-tests authorization boundaries and business logic exploits that were remediated

If Pass 2 finds new issues, fix and re-verify until clean.

## Step 7 — Regression Checklist
**Nightwing** `subagent_type: nightwing-regression` builds the checklist. Template:

| # | Flow | Steps | Expected | Status |
|---|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | User signup | Go to /signup, fill form, submit | Account created, redirect to dashboard | Pass |
| 2 | Create project | Click "New Project", fill name, submit | Project appears in list | Pass |

Store in `/docs/qa-prompt.md` under "Regression Checklist" section.

## Step 8 — Deliverables
1. Bug tracker (in phase log)
2. Code fixes + new tests
3. Updated `/docs/qa-prompt.md` with regression checklist
4. Release note summary in phase log

## Handoffs
- Security findings → Kenobi (`/security`)
- Architecture issues → Picard (`/architect`)
- Infrastructure issues → Kusanagi (`/devops`)
- UX issues → Galadriel (`/ux`)

Log all handoffs to `/logs/handoffs.md`.
