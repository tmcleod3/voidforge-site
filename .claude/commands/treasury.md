# /treasury — Dockson's Financial Operations

> *"Every coin has a story. I know them all."*

Read `/docs/methods/TREASURY.md` for operating rules.
Read `/docs/methods/HEARTBEAT.md` for daemon architecture.

## Prerequisites
This command requires VoidForge Full (main branch). If `wizard/` does not exist, stop: "Treasury requires the wizard server (main branch). You're on scaffold/core. To get the full version: `npx voidforge init` or `git checkout main`."

## Context Setup
1. Check if financial vault exists (`~/.voidforge/treasury/vault.enc`)
2. Check if heartbeat daemon is running (`~/.voidforge/heartbeat.json`)
3. If no vault: route to setup flow
4. If vault exists but no args: show `--status`

## First-Run Experience (§9.15.1)

When no treasury vault exists:
1. "Treasury manages your project's finances — revenue tracking, ad spend budgets, and reconciliation."
2. Start guided setup: connect one revenue source first (recommend Stripe).
3. After first source connected: "Financial operations require two-factor authentication. Set up now? [Y/n]"
4. TOTP required before connecting ad platforms or enabling spend.
5. After setup: show treasury status with next steps.

## Setup Flow

`/treasury setup`:
1. "Which revenue sources?" → Stripe / Paddle / Skip for now
2. For each selected source:
   - Stripe: "Paste your restricted API key (read-only). Find it at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys"
   - Paddle: "Paste your API key (read-only). Find it in your Paddle dashboard."
3. For each: encrypt → store in financial vault → connection test → initial data pull
4. Show: current balance, last 30 days revenue
5. Offer TOTP setup if not configured
6. Offer heartbeat daemon start if not running
