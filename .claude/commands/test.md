# /test — Batman's Test-Writing Mode

> Different from `/qa` (which finds bugs). `/test` writes and improves tests.

## Context Setup
1. Read `/logs/build-state.md` — understand current project state
2. Read `/docs/methods/QA_ENGINEER.md`
3. Read `/docs/methods/TESTING.md` — testing pyramid, patterns, framework mapping

## Dynamic Dispatch (ADR-044)

Opus scans `git diff --stat` and matches changed files against the `description` fields of all agents in `.claude/agents/`. Matching specialists launch alongside the core agents below.

**Dispatch control:** `--light` skips dynamic dispatch (core only). `--solo` runs lead agent only.

## Silver Surfer Pre-Scan (ADR-048)

**MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS.** Launch the Silver Surfer before deploying ANY other agents. This is not negotiable, not deferrable, and not skippable regardless of how simple the task appears. "The task is simple" is NOT a valid reason to skip — the Surfer catches cross-domain relevance that you cannot predict. "I already know which agents to use" is NOT a valid reason — the Surfer reads agent definitions you haven't loaded. Skipping the Surfer is a protocol violation equivalent to skipping the Victory Gauntlet. **If you find yourself thinking "I don't need the Surfer for this" — that is exactly when you need it most.**

Read the `heralding:` field from `.claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md` and announce it before launching.

**How to launch:** Use the Agent tool with these exact parameters:
- `description`: "Silver Surfer roster scan"
- `prompt`: "You are the Silver Surfer, Herald of Galactus. Read your instructions from .claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md, then execute your task. Command: /test. User args: <ARGS>. Focus: <FOCUS or 'none'>. Scan the .claude/agents/ directory, read agent descriptions and tags, and return the optimal roster for this command on this codebase."

**After the Surfer returns**, deploy the FULL roster — every agent the Surfer selected. Do NOT cherry-pick "key specialists" from the list. The Surfer already curated it. Launch all of them alongside this command's hardcoded leads.

**`--focus "topic"`** — include in the Surfer's prompt as the focus bias.
**`--light`** — skip the Surfer, use only hardcoded roster below.
**`--solo`** — skip Surfer and all sub-agents, lead only.

## Step 0 — Orient
**Oracle** `subagent_type: Oracle` orients:
1. Detect: test framework, test runner, test directory structure, existing coverage
2. Run `npm test` to establish baseline — how many tests, how many pass, how many fail
3. Document in phase log: framework, runner, config, current state

## Step 1 — Coverage Analysis (parallel)
Use the Agent tool to run these in parallel:
- **Agent 1** `subagent_type: Oracle` — Gap analysis: scan all source files, check for corresponding test files, identify tested vs missing paths.
- **Agent 2** `subagent_type: Alfred` — Test infrastructure: review test config, fixtures, factories, mocks, test utilities, test database, shared helpers.

Synthesize into a coverage map:

| Module | Type | Test File | Paths Covered | Paths Missing | Priority |
|--------|------|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|

Priority: Critical path > User-facing > Internal > Utility

## Step 2 — Test Architecture
**Nightwing** `subagent_type: Nightwing` reviews existing tests for quality:
- Are tests testing behavior or implementation details?
- Are tests isolated (no test-order dependency)?
- Are assertions specific (not just "doesn't throw")?
- Are test names descriptive ("should reject expired tokens" not "test auth")?
- Is there appropriate use of the testing pyramid (unit > integration > e2e)?

Flag anti-patterns:
- Tests that always pass (testing nothing)
- Tests that test the framework, not the code
- Excessive mocking that hides real bugs
- Tests coupled to implementation details

## Step 3 — Write Missing Tests (`subagent_type: Batman` leads)
Write tests in priority order from Step 1. For each module:

1. **Unit tests** for pure business logic (services, utils, validators)
   - Happy path + edge cases + error cases
   - Follow patterns from `/docs/methods/TESTING.md`

2. **Integration tests** for API routes
   - Request validation (missing fields, wrong types, unauthorized)
   - Success path with response shape verification
   - Error responses (404, 403, 422, 500)

3. **Component tests** for UI (if applicable)
   - All four states: loading, empty, error, success
   - User interactions (click, type, submit)
   - Keyboard navigation

Work in small batches — write tests for one module, run `npm test`, verify they pass, then move to the next.

## Step 3.5 — Integration Tests (`subagent_type: Oracle`)
For each new feature, write at least one test that exercises the full cross-module path:
- **File handling:** upload file → verify returned URL → fetch URL → verify 200 + correct content-type
- **Form save with conflict:** submit with duplicate/conflicting value → verify response includes specific error message (not generic)
- **Bulk operations:** upload CSV/batch → verify created count + per-row error details
- **Generated URLs/keys:** verify the URL/key pattern is accepted by the serving endpoint (proxy, CDN, static handler)
- **Error propagation:** trigger a server error → verify the client receives and can display the specific error

These can use mocked databases but MUST cross module boundaries — the test should touch at least two modules that would be reviewed by different agents.

## Step 4 — Hardening
**Red Hood** `subagent_type: Red Hood` writes adversarial tests:
- Boundary values (0, -1, MAX_INT, empty string, null, undefined)
- Unicode and special characters in all string inputs
- Concurrent operations (race conditions, double-submit)
- Large payloads (100MB upload, 10K item list)
- Missing/malformed auth tokens

## Step 5 — Verify Suite
1. Run full test suite: `npm test`
2. All tests pass (fix any that don't)
3. No flaky tests (run suite 3x if suspicious)
4. Tests run in < 60 seconds (flag slow tests)
5. Update `/docs/qa-prompt.md` with new test coverage state

## Deliverables
1. New and improved test files
2. Test utilities/helpers/fixtures (if created)
3. Updated coverage map in phase log
4. List of remaining gaps (backlog)

## Arguments
- `--focus "topic"` → Bias Herald toward topic (natural-language, additive)

## Handoffs
- Security test gaps → Kenobi (`/security`)
- UI test gaps → Galadriel (`/ux`)
- Infrastructure test issues → Kusanagi (`/devops`)

Log all handoffs to `/logs/handoffs.md`.
