# /security — Kenobi's Security Audit

**AGENT DEPLOYMENT IS MANDATORY.** Phase 1 specifies parallel agent launches via the Agent tool. You MUST launch Leia, Chewie, Rex+Bo-Katan, and Maul as separate sub-processes. Phase 2 agents (Yoda, Windu, Ahsoka, Padmé, Qui-Gon) run sequentially but each MUST be a separate agent invocation. Do NOT shortcut to inline analysis. (Field report #68)

## Dynamic Dispatch (ADR-044)

Opus scans `git diff --stat` and matches changed files against the `description` fields of all agents in `.claude/agents/`. Matching specialists launch alongside the core agents below.

**Dispatch control:** `--light` skips dynamic dispatch (core only). `--solo` runs lead agent only.

## Silver Surfer Pre-Scan (ADR-048)

**MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS.** Launch the Silver Surfer before deploying ANY other agents. This is not negotiable, not deferrable, and not skippable regardless of how simple the task appears. "The task is simple" is NOT a valid reason to skip — the Surfer catches cross-domain relevance that you cannot predict. "I already know which agents to use" is NOT a valid reason — the Surfer reads agent definitions you haven't loaded. Skipping the Surfer is a protocol violation equivalent to skipping the Victory Gauntlet. **If you find yourself thinking "I don't need the Surfer for this" — that is exactly when you need it most.**

Read the `heralding:` field from `.claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md` and announce it before launching.

**How to launch:** Use the Agent tool with these exact parameters:
- `description`: "Silver Surfer roster scan"
- `prompt`: "You are the Silver Surfer, Herald of Galactus. Read your instructions from .claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md, then execute your task. Command: /security. User args: <ARGS>. Focus: <FOCUS or 'none'>. Scan the .claude/agents/ directory, read agent descriptions and tags, and return the optimal roster for this command on this codebase."

**After the Surfer returns**, deploy the FULL roster — every agent the Surfer selected. Do NOT cherry-pick "key specialists" from the list. The Surfer already curated it. Launch all of them alongside this command's hardcoded leads.

**`--focus "topic"`** — include in the Surfer's prompt as the focus bias.
**`--light`** — skip the Surfer, use only hardcoded roster below.
**`--solo`** — skip Surfer and all sub-agents, lead only.

## Context Setup
1. Read `/logs/build-state.md` — understand current project state
2. Read `/docs/methods/SECURITY_AUDITOR.md`
3. Read `/docs/LESSONS.md` — check for security-relevant lessons (prior vulnerabilities, auth gotchas). Flag matches during audit.

## Audit Sequence

### Phase 0.5 — First Strike
Before the deep audits, two agents do fast recon:
- **Han** `subagent_type: Han` — Quick OWASP top 10 scan: finds the obvious vulnerabilities that shouldn't require deep analysis. Shoots first.
- **Cassian** `subagent_type: Cassian` — Threat modeling and attack surface mapping: all endpoints, high-value targets, threat model that guides the rest of the audit.

### Phase 1 — Independent audits (parallel analysis)
Use the Agent tool to run these simultaneously — all are read-only analysis:
- **Agent 1** `subagent_type: Leia` — Secrets: scan for hardcoded secrets, verify .env gitignored, check git history for leaked keys, verify different secrets dev/prod.
- **Agent 2** `subagent_type: Chewie` — Dependencies: `npm audit`, critical/high vulns, lock file committed, deprecated packages.
- **Agent 3** `subagent_type: Rex` + `bo-katan-perimeter` — Infrastructure + perimeter: security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, CORS), TLS config, exposed ports/debug endpoints, firewall rules, CORS enforcement.
- **Agent 4** `subagent_type: Maul` — Red team: exploit each endpoint/flow, chain vulnerabilities, test trust boundaries, attempt privilege escalation. **RUNTIME EXPLOITATION (mandatory):** Execute actual attack requests via curl/fetch -- not just theorize.

### Phase 2 — Sequential audits (depend on understanding the codebase)
These require full codebase context — run sequentially:

- **Yoda** `subagent_type: Yoda` — Auth: password hashing (bcrypt >= 12 rounds), session management (httpOnly/secure/sameSite), OAuth (state param, redirect whitelist), reset tokens (single-use, expiring, rate limited). Reference `/docs/patterns/middleware.ts`.
- **Windu** `subagent_type: Windu` — Input: SQL injection (parameterized queries), XSS (escaped output, CSP), SSRF (URL allowlist), command injection, path traversal.
- **Ahsoka** `subagent_type: Ahsoka` — Access control: IDOR checks, UUIDs not sequential IDs, server-side admin/tier verification, rate limiting. **AUTH CHAIN TRACING (mandatory):** Trace the full chain from middleware registration through service to DB query. Reference `/docs/patterns/multi-tenant.ts`.
- **Padme** `subagent_type: Padme` — Data protection: PII catalog, PII not in logs/errors/URLs, GDPR deletion, encrypted backups.
- **Qui-Gon** `subagent_type: Qui-Gon` — Subtle vulnerabilities: timing attacks, race conditions in auth flows, logic errors that pass standard checks.
- **Sabine** `subagent_type: Sabine` — (conditional) Unconventional: supply chain attacks, dependency confusion, prototype pollution, CSP bypass via CDN.
- **Bail Organa** `subagent_type: Bail Organa` — (conditional) Governance: GDPR data handling, SOC2 controls, HIPAA mapping.

### Phase 3 — Remediate
Write all findings to `/logs/phase-11-security-audit.md` (or appropriate phase log):

| ID | Finding | Severity | Confidence | Category | Location | Remediation | Status |
|----|---------|----------|------------|----------|----------|-------------|--------|

Severity = exploitability x impact. Critical (auth bypass, data leak) > High (injection, IDOR) > Medium (missing headers, weak config) > Low (best practice)

**Confidence scoring is mandatory.** Every finding includes a confidence score (0-100). If confidence is below 60, escalate to a second agent from a different universe (e.g., if Maul found it, escalate to Deathstroke or Constantine) to verify before including. If the second agent disagrees, drop the finding. High-confidence findings (90+) skip re-verification in Phase 4.

Fix critical and high findings immediately. Medium findings get tracked. For each fix:
1. Apply the fix
2. Verify it works
3. Check it didn't break anything (`npm test`)
4. Update the finding status in the log

### Phase 4 — Re-Verification
After remediations are applied:
- **Maul** `subagent_type: Maul` re-probes all remediated vulnerabilities — verify fixes hold under adversarial conditions. Execute actual HTTP requests against the running server.
- **Anakin** `subagent_type: Anakin` attempts to bypass remediations using dark-side techniques — JWT algorithm confusion, auth library edge cases, prototype pollution, framework misuse.
- **Din Djarin** `subagent_type: Din Djarin` bounty-hunts for anything Maul and Anakin missed — post-remediation sweep.

If any agent finds new issues, fix and re-verify until clean.

### Phase 5 — Deliverables
1. SECURITY_AUDIT.md — prioritized findings with evidence
2. SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md — reusable pre-deploy verification list
3. Remediation code fixes
4. INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md — if none exists, create template

## Arguments
- `--focus "topic"` → Bias Herald toward topic (natural-language, additive)

## Handoffs
- Backend refactoring needed → Stark, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
- UI changes needed → Galadriel, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
- Infrastructure changes → Kusanagi, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
- Verify fixes didn't break → Batman, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
