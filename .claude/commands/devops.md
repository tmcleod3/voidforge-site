# /devops — Kusanagi's Infrastructure & Deploy

## Context Setup
1. Read `/logs/build-state.md` — understand current project state
2. Read `/docs/PRD.md` frontmatter — check `deploy` value to determine target
3. Read `/docs/methods/DEVOPS_ENGINEER.md`

## Dynamic Dispatch (ADR-044)

Opus scans `git diff --stat` and matches changed files against the `description` fields of all agents in `.claude/agents/`. Matching specialists launch alongside the core agents below.

**Dispatch control:** `--light` skips dynamic dispatch (core only). `--solo` runs lead agent only.

## Silver Surfer Pre-Scan (ADR-048)

**MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS.** Launch the Silver Surfer before deploying ANY other agents. This is not negotiable, not deferrable, and not skippable regardless of how simple the task appears. "The task is simple" is NOT a valid reason to skip — the Surfer catches cross-domain relevance that you cannot predict. "I already know which agents to use" is NOT a valid reason — the Surfer reads agent definitions you haven't loaded. Skipping the Surfer is a protocol violation equivalent to skipping the Victory Gauntlet. **If you find yourself thinking "I don't need the Surfer for this" — that is exactly when you need it most.**

Read the `heralding:` field from `.claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md` and announce it before launching.

**How to launch:** Use the Agent tool with these exact parameters:
- `description`: "Silver Surfer roster scan"
- `prompt`: "You are the Silver Surfer, Herald of Galactus. Read your instructions from .claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md, then execute your task. Command: /devops. User args: <ARGS>. Focus: <FOCUS or 'none'>. Scan the .claude/agents/ directory, read agent descriptions and tags, and return the optimal roster for this command on this codebase."

**After the Surfer returns**, deploy the FULL roster — every agent the Surfer selected. Do NOT cherry-pick "key specialists" from the list. The Surfer already curated it. Launch all of them alongside this command's hardcoded leads.

**`--focus "topic"`** — include in the Surfer's prompt as the focus bias.
**`--light`** — skip the Surfer, use only hardcoded roster below.
**`--solo`** — skip Surfer and all sub-agents, lead only.

## Deploy Target Branching

The infrastructure sequence adapts based on `deploy` in PRD frontmatter:

| Target | Senku | Levi | Spike | L | Bulma |
|--------|-------|------|-------|---|-------|
| `vps` | Full provision.sh | PM2 + deploy.sh | Caddy/Nginx + DNS | Health + uptime | DB backup + cron |
| `vercel` | Skip | `vercel.json` config | DNS only | Vercel analytics | Vercel Postgres backup |
| `railway` | Skip | railway.toml config | DNS only | Railway metrics | Railway backup |
| `docker` | Dockerfile + compose | docker-compose deploy | Traefik/Caddy | Container health | Volume backup |
| `static` | Skip | Static hosting config | DNS + CDN | Uptime monitor only | Skip |

## Sequence — VPS (full)

### Senku — Provisioning
Create `/scripts/provision.sh`:
- System updates, tools, runtime (Node/Python/Ruby per stack)
- Database (Postgres/MySQL), Redis if needed
- Reverse proxy (Caddy preferred), process manager (PM2)
- App user (non-root), firewall (22/80/443 only), fail2ban
- Log rotation, swap, unattended security upgrades
- Script must be idempotent — safe to run twice

### Levi — Deployment
Create `/scripts/deploy.sh`:
- Pull latest code → `npm ci` → generate ORM → migrate → build → reload PM2 → health check
- Auto-rollback on health check failure
- Create `/scripts/rollback.sh` for manual rollback

### Spike — Networking
- Caddyfile or nginx config with HTTPS, gzip, security headers
- SSL auto-renewal
- DNS records documented
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC for email sending

### PM2 Config
Create `ecosystem.config.js`:
- Web: cluster mode (>= 2 instances), memory limit
- Workers: fork mode, memory limit
- Auto-start on reboot (`pm2 startup` + `pm2 save`)

### L — Monitoring
- Health endpoint: `/api/health` checking DB, Redis (if used), disk space
- External uptime monitor (document which service)
- Structured request logging (method, path, status, duration)
- Error tracking integration
- Slow query logging (>1s)
- Alerts: CPU >80%, Memory >85%, Disk >80%

### Bulma — Backup
Create `/scripts/backup-db.sh`:
- Compressed database dump
- Upload to off-site storage (R2/S3)
- 30-day retention, auto-cleanup
- Daily cron job
- **Test restore at least once** — document the procedure

### Holo — Cost
Document in `/docs/INFRASTRUCTURE.md`:
- Monthly hosting cost
- Per-user cost at current and projected scale
- Most expensive service
- Right-sizing recommendations

## First-Deploy Pre-flight Checklist

Before the first production deployment:

- [ ] All environment variables set on server (compare against .env.example)
- [ ] Secrets are production values (not dev/test keys)
- [ ] Database created and accessible from server
- [ ] Database seeded with required initial data (admin user, default config)
- [ ] DNS records pointed to server IP
- [ ] SSL certificate provisioned (or auto-provision configured)
- [ ] Firewall rules active (22/80/443 only)
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] Deploy script tested on a staging environment first (if available)
- [ ] Rollback script tested
- [ ] Backup script runs successfully
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured and tested
- [ ] Error tracking receives test errors
- [ ] Kenobi has reviewed server security configuration

Log all results to `/logs/phase-12-deploy.md`.

## Post-Deploy Smoke Tests

After the first production deployment (and after each subsequent deploy), verify the application works at runtime — not just the infrastructure:

- **Health check:** `/api/health` returns 200 (already in checklist above)
- **Primary user flow:** Execute the core journey against the production URL via curl/fetch — verify end-to-end
- **File serving:** If the app serves uploaded files (via proxy, CDN, or storage), upload a test file and fetch its URL — verify HTTP 200 + correct content-type
- **Error handling:** Submit intentionally invalid data to a form endpoint — verify the error response is specific (not a generic 500)
- **Auth flow:** If auth exists, verify login → authenticated request → logout works against production
- **Cross-module paths:** Verify any URL/key/path patterns generated by the app are accepted by their serving endpoints in production

If any smoke test fails, halt the deploy and run `/scripts/rollback.sh` before investigating.

## Deliverables
1. /scripts/ (provision.sh, deploy.sh, rollback.sh, backup-db.sh)
2. /docs/RUNBOOK.md — operational procedures for 3am debugging
3. /docs/INFRASTRUCTURE.md — server inventory, DNS, costs
4. ecosystem.config.js (or equivalent)
5. Reverse proxy config
6. Cron jobs documented
7. Monitoring configured

## Arguments
- `--focus "topic"` → Bias Herald toward topic (natural-language, additive)

## Handoffs
- Code bugs found during deploy → Batman, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
- Security config review → Kenobi, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
- Scaling architecture → Picard, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
- App performance issues → Stark, log to `/logs/handoffs.md`
