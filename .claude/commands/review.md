# /review — Picard's Code Review

> Pattern compliance, code quality, and maintainability review. Picard-affiliated (Star Trek).

## Dynamic Dispatch (ADR-044)

Opus scans `git diff --stat` and matches changed files against the `description` fields of all agents in `.claude/agents/`. Matching specialists launch alongside the core agents below.

**Dispatch control:** `--light` skips dynamic dispatch (core only). `--solo` runs lead agent only.

## Silver Surfer Pre-Scan (ADR-048)

**MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS.** Launch the Silver Surfer before deploying ANY other agents. This is not negotiable, not deferrable, and not skippable regardless of how simple the task appears. "The task is simple" is NOT a valid reason to skip — the Surfer catches cross-domain relevance that you cannot predict. "I already know which agents to use" is NOT a valid reason — the Surfer reads agent definitions you haven't loaded. Skipping the Surfer is a protocol violation equivalent to skipping the Victory Gauntlet. **If you find yourself thinking "I don't need the Surfer for this" — that is exactly when you need it most.**

Read the `heralding:` field from `.claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md` and announce it before launching.

**How to launch:** Use the Agent tool with these exact parameters:
- `description`: "Silver Surfer roster scan"
- `prompt`: "You are the Silver Surfer, Herald of Galactus. Read your instructions from .claude/agents/silver-surfer-herald.md, then execute your task. Command: /review. User args: <ARGS>. Focus: <FOCUS or 'none'>. Scan the .claude/agents/ directory, read agent descriptions and tags, and return the optimal roster for this command on this codebase."

**After the Surfer returns**, deploy the FULL roster — every agent the Surfer selected. Do NOT cherry-pick "key specialists" from the list. The Surfer already curated it. Launch all of them alongside this command's hardcoded leads.

**`--focus "topic"`** — include in the Surfer's prompt as the focus bias.
**`--light`** — skip the Surfer, use only hardcoded roster below.
**`--solo`** — skip Surfer and all sub-agents, lead only.

## Context Setup
1. Read `/logs/build-state.md` — understand current project state
2. Read the relevant pattern files from `/docs/patterns/` for the code being reviewed
3. Read `/docs/LESSONS.md` — check for review-relevant lessons (integration tracing gaps, render loops, cross-module issues). Flag matches during review.

## Step 0 — Scope
Determine what to review:
- If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies files/directories, review those
- If no arguments, review all changed files since last commit: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1`
- If reviewing a feature branch: `git diff --name-only main...HEAD`

List all files in scope and their types (API route, service, component, middleware, config).

## Agent Deployment Manifest

**Lead:** `subagent_type: Picard` — architecture lens, final arbiter
**Core team (always deployed):**
- `subagent_type: Spock` — pattern compliance + integration tracing
- `subagent_type: Seven` — code quality, dead code, complexity
- `subagent_type: Data` — maintainability, error paths, state flow

**Stark's Marvel team (deployed on backend-heavy reviews):**
- `subagent_type: Rogers` — API design: HTTP semantics, response shapes, REST conventions
- `subagent_type: Banner` — database: query patterns, N+1, missing indexes
- `subagent_type: Strange` — service architecture: separation of concerns, logic placement
- `subagent_type: Barton` — error handling: try/catch completeness, error propagation
- `subagent_type: Romanoff` — security implications (lightweight — flags for Kenobi)
- `subagent_type: Thor` — performance: re-renders, expensive computations, memoization
- `subagent_type: Wanda` — state management: store design, prop drilling, context boundaries
- `subagent_type: T'Challa` — API integration: external service calls, retry logic, fallback

**Cross-domain agents (deployed based on content):**
- `subagent_type: Nightwing` — auth flow end-to-end: signup→verify→login→protected→logout
- `subagent_type: Bilbo` — copy audit: error messages, UI text, API descriptions
- `subagent_type: Troi` — PRD compliance: does the code match what the PRD describes?
- `subagent_type: Constantine` — cursed code: accidental correctness, tautological checks, shadowed vars
- `subagent_type: Samwise` — a11y spot-check: keyboard nav and ARIA

## Step 1 — Parallel Analysis
Use the Agent tool to run these in parallel — all are read-only analysis:

- **Agent 1** `subagent_type: Spock` — Pattern compliance: check each file against its matching pattern in `/docs/patterns/` (api-route, service, component, middleware, error-handling, job-queue, multi-tenant). **INTEGRATION TRACING (mandatory):** When reviewed code generates URLs, references endpoints, constructs storage keys, or produces data consumed by other modules — read the consuming code to verify compatibility.
- **Agent 2** `subagent_type: Seven` — Code quality: unnecessary complexity, dead code, unused imports, duplicated logic, inconsistent naming, missing types/`any` usage, SRP violations.
- **Agent 3** `subagent_type: Data` — Maintainability + error paths + state flow: wrong abstractions, module coupling, missing boundary error handling, hardcoded values, misleading comments.
- **Agent 4** `subagent_type: Rogers` + `banner-database` + `strange-service-arch` — Backend review (if backend code in scope): REST conventions, response shapes, N+1 queries, indexes, separation of concerns.
- **Agent 5** `subagent_type: Nightwing` + `constantine-cursed-code` — Cross-domain (if auth or complex logic in scope): auth flow tracing, accidental correctness detection.
- **Agent 6** `subagent_type: Bilbo` + `troi-prd-compliance` — Copy + PRD (if UI or user-facing code in scope): clear error messages, PRD compliance verification.

**ROUTE COLLISION CHECK (mandatory for web apps):** When a new router/route file is added, list ALL registered routes (method + path) across ALL routers. Check for duplicate method+path combinations. Frameworks like FastAPI silently shadow duplicate routes — the first registered wins.

**REACT STATE FLOW ANALYSIS (mandatory for React projects):**
For every `useEffect` in new/modified components:
1. List what store values it reads (dependency array)
2. List what store actions it calls (effect body)
3. Check: does any action trigger a store update that changes a value in the dependency array? If yes → infinite render loop.
4. Check: does the effect call `.focus()` or other DOM methods that should only run once? If yes → needs a ref guard.
5. If a component has 3+ `useEffect` hooks with store dependencies, flag for manual render-cycle review.

**ERROR PATH VERIFICATION (mandatory):** For every API route that returns error responses (4xx, 5xx), identify the client that calls this endpoint and verify:
- The client reads the response body (not just checks `res.ok`)
- The specific error message/code is displayed to the user
- Generic fallback messages are only used when the server truly returns no useful error info
- The UI form state after error allows retry without losing user input

## Step 1.5 — Conflict Detection
After parallel analysis completes, scan findings from all agents for conflicts:
- **Same code, different verdicts:** Spock says "pattern violation" but Data says "intentional trade-off"
- **Severity disagreements:** Seven says "Must Fix" but Spock says "Consider"
- **Contradictory fixes:** One agent's fix would break another agent's recommendation

For each conflict, trigger the debate protocol (see SUB_AGENTS.md "Agent Debate Protocol"): Agent A states finding → Agent B responds → Agent A rebuts → Arbiter (Picard) decides. 3 exchanges max. Log the debate transcript as an ADR. The winning position becomes the canonical finding in Step 2. Do NOT list both opinions — resolve them.

## Step 2 — Synthesize Findings
Merge all findings into a review table (conflicts already resolved via Step 1.5):

| # | File | Line | Category | Severity | Confidence | Finding | Suggestion |
|---|------|------|----------|----------|------------|---------|-----------|

Categories: Pattern, Quality, Maintainability
Severity: Must Fix > Should Fix > Consider > Nit

**Confidence scoring is mandatory.** Every finding includes a confidence score (0-100). If confidence is below 60, escalate to a second agent from a different universe (e.g., if Spock found it, escalate to Oracle or Stark) to verify before including. If the second agent disagrees, drop the finding. High-confidence findings (90+) skip re-verification in Step 3.5.

## Step 3 — Fix (small batches)
Fix "Must Fix" and "Should Fix" items. After each batch:
1. Re-run `npm test`
2. Verify the fix didn't change behavior
3. Update review table status

"Consider" and "Nit" items are presented to the user for decision.

## Step 3.5 — Re-Verify Fixes
After fixes are applied:
- **Spock** `subagent_type: Spock` re-checks pattern compliance on modified files
- **Seven** `subagent_type: Seven` confirms no new complexity or dead code introduced by fixes

If new issues found, fix and re-verify.

## Step 4 — Deliverables
1. Review findings table (in phase log or conversation)
2. Code fixes for Must Fix and Should Fix items
3. Remaining suggestions for user decision

## Arguments
- `--focus "topic"` → Bias Herald toward topic (natural-language, additive)

## Handoffs
- Security findings → Kenobi (`/security`)
- UX/a11y findings → Galadriel (`/ux`)
- Architecture concerns → Picard (`/architect`)
- Bug discoveries → Batman (`/qa`)

Log all handoffs to `/logs/handoffs.md`.
